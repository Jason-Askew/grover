medical certificate do I need for JobSeeker Payment?","answer":"To provide a medical certificate for JobSeeker Payment, you can use one of the following options:\n\n1. **Centrelink Medical Certificate**: This can be filled out online or printed and completed by hand. It must include specific details about your illness, injury, or disability, including:\n   - What the condition is.\n   - How long it will take for you to recover.\n   - The period you’ll be unable to work, participate, or study.\n\n2. **Non-Centrelink Medical Certificate**: Your doctor may use their own form, but it must contain the required information and be signed by the doctor.\n\nYou need to submit this medical certificate if you are either making a new claim for JobSeeker Payment or are already receiving it and are unable to meet your mutual obligation requirements due to sickness or
