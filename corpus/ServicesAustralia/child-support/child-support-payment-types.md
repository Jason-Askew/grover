# Child support payment types

When you’ve decided what your child support arrangement will be, you’ll need to choose how to transfer payments.

There are 2 different ways to pay or receive child support:

-   [Child Support Collect](/child-support-collect?context=60015)
-   [Private Collect](/private-collect?context=60015).

We have information to help compare your child support collection options.

Find out [how to apply for a child support assessment](/how-to-apply-for-child-support-assessment?context=60015) for a child support assessment.

There’s also help for [non-parent carers](/support-for-foster-carers-and-other-non-parent-carers).

## Child support and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A

How you transfer your child support payments, either privately or through us, can impact your FTB.

If you receive child support payments privately from the other parent and your child support payments change during an assessment period, this may affect your FTB. For more information:

-   find out [how child support affects your family payments](/how-child-support-affects-ftb-part-payment-rates?context=22151)
-   call the [Child Support enquiry line](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your options.
