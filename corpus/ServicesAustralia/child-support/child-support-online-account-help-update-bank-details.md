## Step 2: update bank details

On the **Bank account** details page, we’ll display the account details you’ve given us before. To protect your personal information, we’ll only show the last 4 digits of your account number. If you don’t recognise these details, [contact us](/phone-us).

If these details are incorrect, delete them and enter your new bank account details. Select **Next**.
