# Child Support online accounts

The easiest way to manage your child support payments and details is online.

You need a [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) account to set up and use your Child Support online account.

If you don’t have a myGov account, it’s easy to create one. If you need help, read about how to [create a myGov account](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account) on the myGov website.

You’ll need to go to the myGov website to [link Child Support to your myGov account](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/link-child-support). You only need to do this once.

We keep all your personal and financial details private. Read about your [right to privacy](/your-right-to-privacy).

For your account to work, you must have cookies and JavaScript enabled in your browser. We support most internet browsers and assistive technologies. We’re always improving our service to support the browsers you use.

If you need help in your language, [call the Child Support Enquiry Line](#toolbar-phone) and ask for an interpreter. We will provide one for free.

## Employers and financial institutions

Employers and financial institutions can use [Child Support Online Business Services](/child-support-business-online-services) to manage child support deductions.

Contact numbers available on this page.
