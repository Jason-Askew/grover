# Child Support Information for medical professionals

Medical professionals may be asked to provide a statement of evidence about the wellbeing of a parent involved in a Child Support arrangement.

If a parent's health circumstances change and it affects their capacity to work, they can ask us to change their Child Support arrangement.

As their medical professional, you may be asked to provide evidence that the parent is under your care and they are unable to continue work.

You may be asked to complete a [request for medical information form](/cs4597) by a patient to confirm their medical condition, which may impact on a decision to change a Child Support arrangement.

The information you provide will help us make a change of assessment decision under the _Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989_.

## The Child Support Guide

The Department of Social Services [Child Support Guide](http://guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide) outlines the administration of the Child Support Scheme.
