# Assessments for parents with second families

If you have children from a new family, we reflect this in your assessment.

## on this page

-   [Who a relevant dependent child is](#a1)
-   [What your relevant dependent child amount is](#a2)
-   [How stepchildren affect assessments](#a3)
-   [How to let us know about relevant dependent children](#a4)

When we work out the income to calculate your child support payments we can deduct an amount to support any relevant dependent children. These are children other than the ones in your child support assessment.

We can do this for either parent. We can’t do it if the child is part of another child support assessment.

## Who a relevant dependent child is

The child must be in your care for at least 128 nights a year.

They can be either your:

-   biological child
-   adopted child
-   stepchild if a court order says you have a duty to maintain them
-   child from artificial conception - you and the other parent were married or in a de facto relationship at the time of conception and you consented to the artificial conception procedure
-   child from a surrogacy arrangement.

## What your relevant dependent child amount is

We work this out using the [costs of children](/basic-child-support-formula?context=21911#costsofchildren) table and your [child support income](/how-your-income-affects-your-child-support?context=21911) amount.

We only consider your income – not your partner’s.

## How stepchildren affect assessments

You can apply to [change your assessment in special circumstances](/changing-your-child-support-assessment-special-circumstances?context=21911) if you’re caring for your stepchild and both of the following apply:

-   neither legal parent can financially support the child
-   you pay child support for any other children.

Your reason for applying is [reason 10](/changing-your-child-support-assessment-special-circumstances?context=21911).

## How to let us know about relevant dependent children

If you have an existing child support assessment and have a dependent child come into your care, you should provide all of the following details in a document:

-   the child's first name
-   the child's last name
-   the child's date of birth
-   your care arrangements for the child.
