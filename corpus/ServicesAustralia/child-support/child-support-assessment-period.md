# The assessment period

A child support period is the amount of time an assessment covers. It can be up to 15 months.

## When a new child support period starts

A child support period will either start:

-   on the day you make an application for child support
-   on the day you make an application to accept a child support agreement, if it starts a new case
-   on the day a child support agreement changes a child support assessment,
-   the day after the current child support period ends
-   when the ATO tells us new income information for the most recent financial year, if that year of income isn’t already used in an assessment.

If a new ATO income starts a child support period, it either starts:

-   on the 1st day of the next month if we receive the ATO income by the 15th of the month
-   on the 1st day of the month after next if we receive the ATO income after the 15th of the month.

## What happens if there are changes during a child support period

We might need to update your assessment. You must tell us as soon as you can if your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21911). For example, we need to know if either:

-   your income changes
-   the amount of time the child lives with you changes.

Changes to the care arrangements can affect a child support assessment. You need to tell us about changes straight away. If you don’t tell us within 28 days any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.
