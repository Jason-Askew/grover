# Care percentage estimator

The care estimator is a tool that calculates your care percentage.

We use this figure when we decide:

-   who pays child support
-   how much you pay or receive

Read about [the assessment formula](/child-support-assessment-formula?context=21911).

## How it works

Open the [care estimator](https://processing.csa.gov.au/ChildSupportFormula/CareEstimator.aspx) then follow the steps:

### Step 1

Enter the **Care period start date**. This starts on the day the care changed and usually ends 12 months later.

### Step 2

Choose either:

-   **select recurring care** – the nights the child lived with you every week
-   **manually select care dates** – single nights the child lived with you.

### Step 3

In the **Total care estimate** box, select **Calculate**. The box will show your:

-   total nights of care
-   care percentage
-   care level.
