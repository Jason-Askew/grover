-   [The Child Support Guide](#a2)

Most parents who separate will come to us about the amount, types and collection options for their child support payments.

As a financial counsellor, a parent or non-parent carer may ask you for advice about their financial matters. You also play an important role in assisting us to better understand the full extent of a customer’s situation. This can help us reach sustainable outcomes for both parents.

You may get asked about what impact child support can have on their finances. This may include questions about any of the following:

-   general budgeting advice
-   tax implications
-   financial planning
-   child support payment options
-   managing debts.

We have information on our website to help you answer questions about any of the following:
