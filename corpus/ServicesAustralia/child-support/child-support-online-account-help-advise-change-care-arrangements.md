# Child Support online account help - Advise change of care arrangements

Instructions on how to tell us about a change of care arrangements using your Child Support online account.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#a1)
-   [Step 2: advise change of care](#a2)
-   [Step 3: care arrangements](#step3)
-   [Step 4: review and submit](#a4)
-   [Step 5: receipt](#a5)
-   [Step 6: sign out](#a6)

A change of care arrangements may affect the child support you pay or receive from the other parent.

Delays in telling us about a care change can affect your child support assessment. If you are telling us about a change of care which happened more than 28 days ago, any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.

## Step 1: get started

From your homepage, select **Advise a change of care** from **Quick links**.
