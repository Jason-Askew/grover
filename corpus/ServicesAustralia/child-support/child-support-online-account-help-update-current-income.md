# Child Support online account help - Update current income

Instructions on how to update your income for the current financial year using your Child Support online account.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#a1)
-   [Step 2: update your income](#a2)
-   [Step 3: review and submit](#a3)
-   [Step 4: receipt](#a4)
-   [Step 5: sign out](#a5)

We use your adjusted taxable income from the previous financial year to work out how much child support you need to pay. If your current income is different to the amount in your assessment, you may be able to [lodge an estimate](/how-your-income-affects-your-child-support?context=21911#estimate).

We’ll only consider your first estimate if your income has dropped by 15% or more.

Use this guide if you need to estimate your current income for this financial year. If you already have an estimate in place, you’ll need to update it, even if it hasn’t changed.

It’s important to keep your income details up to date. This includes any increase or decrease to your income during the financial year. This helps make sure your child support assessment and child support payments are accurate.

You will need to give us both:
