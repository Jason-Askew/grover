## Our payments that may help you

We have payments to help in crisis situations.

The type of payment you may get depends on your situation.

[Additional Child Care Subsidy Temporary Financial Hardship](/temporary-financial-hardship-additional-child-care-subsidy) gives extra help with the cost of approved child care. It’s short-term help if you’re in financial hardship due to events outside your control. This includes when a major disaster event has adversely affected your family.

[Crisis Payment](/crisis-payment) is a one-off payment if you’re in financial hardship, have experienced an extreme circumstance and get a qualifying payment.

[Carer Adjustment Payment](/carer-adjustment-payment) is a one-off payment if your child under 7 gets a severe illness or major disability. The illness or disability must be because of a catastrophic event.

You may get an [early release of your super](/early-release-superannuation) in limited circumstances. Find out [how to apply on compassionate grounds](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/super/withdrawing-and-using-your-super/early-access-to-super/access-on-compassionate-grounds/how-to-apply-for-release-on-compassionate-grounds) through the Australian Taxation Office website. If you’re in severe financial hardship, apply to your super fund.

If you already get an income support payment or Family Tax Benefit, you may be able to get an [advance lump sum payment](/advance-payment). An advance lump sum payment is like a loan from your Centrelink payment. You get some of your payment early as a lump sum amount. You then pay that back by getting a bit less in your next 13 payments.

[Special Benefit](/special-benefit) may be able to help support you or your dependents. This is only if you can’t get any other income support payment and meet the [eligibility rules](/who-can-get-special-benefit).

## Our services that may help you

We have a range of services for when you need help.

Our [social workers](/social-work-services) provide short term counselling, support and can refer you to other services. You can contact a social worker by calling your regular payment line and asking to speak to a social worker.

Our [Community Engagement Officers](/community-engagement-officers) help you access payments and services if you find it hard to access them.

You can use [Centrepay](/centrepay) to pay bills and expenses as regular deductions from your Centrelink payments. This may make it easier for you to manage your budget.

The [Financial Information Service](/financial-information-service) (FIS) provides free, independent and confidential education to help you make informed decisions about your financial needs. The service is available even if you don’t get a payment from us. Find out how you can [contact a FIS Officer](/how-to-contact-financial-information-service).

We have information to help you [manage your money](/manage-your-money). Find out about budgets, how to deal with debt, understanding loans and credit, what to consider when renting or buying goods and how to build savings.
