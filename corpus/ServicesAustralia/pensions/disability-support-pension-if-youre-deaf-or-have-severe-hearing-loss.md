## How to meet the general medical rules

To meet the DSP general medical rules if you’re deaf or have severe hearing loss, the [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) must show that both:

-   the diagnosis has been made by a qualified medical practitioner
-   additional evidence from an audiologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, or an ear, nose and throat specialist supports the diagnosis.

A permanent and severe hearing loss can include where there is severe or extreme functional impact on your hearing or other functions of the ear. Examples of this functional impact can include if you:

-   have severe difficulty hearing any conversation even if it’s at a raised volume in a room with no background noise
-   have severe difficulty hearing sounds needed for personal or workplace safety such as an alarm or siren
-   are completely reliant in all situations on sign language such as Auslan or have difficulty recognising sign language
-   have continual difficulty with balance, such as having continual dizziness
-   have continual ringing in the ears that interferes with hearing due to a medically diagnosed disorder of the inner ear such as Meniere’s disease.

You’ll also need to meet the [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) such as age and residency.

If you want to claim DSP, you’ll need to submit a claim and give us medical evidence.

If you’re getting DSP because you’re deaf or have severe hearing loss, you must also meet the [income and asset](/income-and-assets-tests-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) test.

## Claim Age Pension if you’re eligible

If you’re Age Pension age and deaf or have severe hearing loss, you should check [Age Pension](/age-pension) for eligibility information.

## Find out about DSP rules in our DSP guide

You can use our [DSP pre-claim guide](/before-claiming-disability-support-pension?context=22276) to help you decide whether to claim DSP. It won’t tell you if you’ll get DSP.

## Ask someone to act for you

You can ask [someone to act for you](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22276) with Medicare, Centrelink, aged care or Child Support. You can authorise them to speak to us, update your details and get payments for you.
