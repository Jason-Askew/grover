# Assets test

The assets test helps us work out if you can get paid Disability Support Pension. It also affects how much you'll get.

We assess all [asset types](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/asset-types?context=22276) as part of the assets test. How much we can pay you depends on the value of your assets, your homeownership status and if you’re in a relationship. There are limits to how much you can have to get a pension. We call these the assets test limits. The Department of Social Services reviews these limits and cut off points in January, March, July and September each year.

Your [assets](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/asset-types?context=22276) include any property or possessions you own in full, in part, or have an interest in. This includes both:

- assets held outside Australia
- debts owed to you.

## What the limits are for a full pension

When your assets are more than the limit for your situation, your pension will reduce.

If you’re a member of a couple, the limit is for both your and your partner’s assets combined, not each of you.

| Your situation | Homeowner | Non-homeowner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single | $321,500 | $579,500 |
| A couple, combined | $481,500 | $739,500 |
| A couple, separated due to illness, combined | $481,500 | $739,500 |
| A couple, one partner eligible, combined | $481,500 | $739,500 |

For every $1,000 in assets above the applicable limit, your rate of pension will reduce by:

- $3 per fortnight, if you’re single
- $1.50 per fortnight for each member of a couple.

## What the limits are for a part pension

Pensions cancel when your assets are over the cut off point for your situation.

If you’re a member of a couple, the limit is for both your and your partner’s assets combined, not each of you.

The following table shows the cut off limits from 1 January 2026.

| Your situation | Homeowner | Non-homeowner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single | $714,500 | $972,500 |
| A couple, combined | $1,074,000 | $1,332,000 |
| A couple, separated due to illness, combined | $1,267,500 | $1,525,500 |
| A couple, one partner eligible, combined | $1,074,000 | $1,332,000 |

If you get [Rent Assistance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/rent-assistance) with your pension, your cut off point is higher.

## What the limits are for transitional rate of pension

Transitional rate pensions cancel when your assets are over your cut off point.

If you’re a member of a couple, the limit is for both your and your partner’s assets combined, not each of you.

The following table shows the cut off limits from 1 January 2026.

| Your situation | Homeowner | Non-homeowner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single | $641,500 | $899,500 |
| A couple, combined | $998,000 | $1,256,000 |
| A couple, separated due to illness, combined | $1,121,500 | $1,379,500 |
| A couple, one partner eligible, combined | $998,000 | $1,256,000 |

If you get [Rent Assistance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/rent-assistance) with your pension, your cut off point is higher. You can find the rates by checking the [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder).

## When you get Disability Support Pension and are younger than 21 with no children

## Where to find other help

You can apply for [Asset Hardship provisions](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/asset-hardship-provisions?context=22276) if you’re in severe financial hardship and your assets mean you either:

- don’t get Disability Support Pension
- get a small amount of Disability Support Pension.

Alternatively you may get help under the [Home Equity Access Scheme](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/home-equity-access-scheme).
