# Payment rates

How much Disability Support Pension (DSP) you can get depends on your situation.

We update the payment rates for Disability Support Pension on 20 March and 20 September each year if you’re either:

- 21 and older, with or without children
- younger than 21 with a child in your care.

On 1 January of each year, we update the rates for those younger than 21 without children.

Your or your partner’s income and assets may affect your payment rate.

## Maximum payment rates

### If you’re younger than 21

If you’re younger than 21 and don’t have any dependent children in your care, there are different rates. In this case, the amount of DSP you get depends on whether we assess you as dependent or independent. We’ll ask you questions about your situation when you claim. You may need to give us proof of your living situation, relationship or work status when you claim. You must tell us if your [circumstances change](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/change-circumstances-while-receiving-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

Whether you’re dependent or independent, your parents’ or guardians’ income won’t affect how much payment you can get.

These rates include Youth Disability Supplement. They don’t include [Pharmaceutical Allowance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/pharmaceutical-allowance) and [Energy Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/energy-supplement).

| Your situation | Maximum rate per fortnight |
| --- | --- |
| Single, younger than 18, and dependent | $581.50 |
| Single, younger than 18, and independent | $839.80 |
| Single, 18 to 20, and dependent | $645.00 |
| Single, 18 to 20, and independent | $839.80 |
| A couple, and younger than 21 | $839.80 |
