# Disability Support Pension

Financial help if you have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric condition that is likely to persist for more than 2 years and stops you from working.

Not everyone with disability or a medical condition can get Disability Support Pension (DSP). If you can’t get DSP, you may be able to get [other payments](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

To get DSP, you need to meet both:

- non-medical rules
- medical rules.

To find out if this is the right payment for you, read more about [who can get it](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/who-can-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

You can also watch our video about DSP.
