# How much you can get

We use income and assets tests to work out how much Age Pension you get.

## on this page

- [Normal rates](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-much-age-pension-you-can-get?context=22526#a1)
- [Transitional rates](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-much-age-pension-you-can-get?context=22526#a2)
- [Tax on your payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-much-age-pension-you-can-get?context=22526#a3)

There are different rates of Age Pension payments for single and partnered people. If you have a partner we need income and asset information for both of you. Read about the pension [income test](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/income-test-for-age-pension?context=22526) and [assets test](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/assets-test-for-age-pension?context=22526).

If you get employment income, this may affect your rate of Age Pension. You must report any employment income you and your partner get, even if it’s under the [income cut off point](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/income-test-for-age-pension?context=22526#cutoff).

You don’t need to give us any payslips unless we ask you for them.

Your [relationship changes](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/relationship-changes) can affect your payment rate.

If you or your partner get [income from or have assets outside Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/income-and-assets-from-outside-australia-can-affect-your-age-pension?context=22526), it may affect your rate.

There are also different rates for some people who were getting a pension in 2009.

The Department of Social Services adjusts these rates every 20 March and 20 September. The amounts on this page are the maximum rates each fortnight.

In some circumstances, you can choose to get your payment each [week](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/weekly-payment-option?context=22526). Depending on your circumstances, you may also get an [advance payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/advance-payment?context=22526).
