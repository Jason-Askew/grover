# Pensioner Concession Card for non-pensioners - 9 October 2017

We may have cancelled your pension payment on 1 January 2017 because of changes to the pension assets test.

If we sent you a non-income tested Low Income Health Care Card, you will regain entitlement to a Pensioner Concession Card on 9 October 2017. This entitlement won't be backdated.

The issuing of the Pensioner Concession Card does not reinstate your pension payment.

You can use your Pensioner Concession Card in the same way as you did before your pension payment was cancelled.

We will send you your Pensioner Concession Card from 9 October 2017, cards may take up to 14 days to arrive in the mail. You can continue to use your [non-income tested Low Income Health Care Card](/low-income-health-care-card) until your Pensioner Concession Card arrives in the mail. After you get your Pensioner Concession Card, your non-income tested Low Income Health Card won’t be valid.
