# Travel outside Australia

There are rules about when you can get Age Pension when you travel outside Australia.

You may be able to get Age Pension for the whole time you’re outside Australia, even if you’re leaving to live in another country.

If you leave within 2 years of returning to Australia to live, your payment may stop if you:

- came back to Australia to live
- started getting Age Pension after you returned
- travel outside Australia during the next 2 years after you returned.

Your payment may be able to continue if you travel to a country we have a [social security agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/which-countries-have-international-social-security-agreements-with-australia) with.
