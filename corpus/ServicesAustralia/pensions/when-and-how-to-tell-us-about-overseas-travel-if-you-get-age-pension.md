## When to tell us about your travel

You need to tell us if you’re leaving Australia and any of the following apply, you:

- are going to live in another country
- will be away for more than 6 weeks, including when you’re going on a cruise into international waters
- get Age Pension under a [social security agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/international-social-security-agreements) with another country
- are leaving Australia within 2 years after coming back to live and started getting Age Pension since then
- or your partner are getting income from employment.

## When you’re getting Carer Payment or Carer Allowance for an Age Pension customer

When you get Carer Payment or Carer Allowance because you’re caring for an Age Pension customer, you should always tell us if you’re travelling overseas separately. This is even if the travel is less than 6 weeks. You must tell us when:

- you’re leaving Australia and the Age Pension customer is staying in Australia
- the Age Pension customer is leaving Australia and you’re staying in Australia
- you’re travelling together but will spend time apart during the trip.

These situations are a respite break from caring.

## How to tell us about your travel

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can tell us about your travel plans online. If you don’t have these, you’ll need to [create them](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use your online account to get information on how your travel could affect your payments and concession cards.

## Other ways to tell us about your travel

If you can’t use an online account, tell us your travel plans by either:

- calling the [Older Australians line](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-and-how-to-tell-us-about-overseas-travel-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#toolbar-phone)
- going to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.
