Check the travel rules for your main [payment while outside Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22321) to find out:

- if you can get your payment when you depart
- when and how to tell us about your travel plans.

If you’re eligible, you’ll get the Pension Supplement for up to 6 weeks at your current rate.

If you travel for more than 6 weeks, your Pension Supplement rate will reduce to the basic amount either:

- after 6 weeks if your travel is short term
- when you depart if you’re leaving to live in another country.

Learn about [pension rates payable](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/payment-schedule-and-rates-for-people-outside-australia?context=22321) if you’re living outside Australia for more than 6 weeks.

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.
