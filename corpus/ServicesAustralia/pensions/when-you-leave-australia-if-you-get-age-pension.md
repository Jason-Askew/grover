# When you leave

Your Age Pension may change when you leave Australia depending on your situation.

## on this page

- [If you leave within 2 years of returning to Australia to live](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-you-leave-australia-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#a1)
- [If you leave Australia for less than 6 weeks](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-you-leave-australia-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#a2)
- [If you leave Australia for more than 26 weeks](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-you-leave-australia-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#a3)
- [If you travel to New Zealand](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-you-leave-australia-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#a4)
- [If you leave to live in another country](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-you-leave-australia-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526#a5)

Any of the following circumstances can affect your payment rate:

- how long you’re away
- if your income and assets change
- how long you were an Australian resident between 16 and Age Pension age
- if you get Age Pension under a [social security agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/international-social-security-agreements) with another country.

Learn more about [payments while outside Australia](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22526).

## If you leave within 2 years of returning to Australia to live

Your Age Pension may stop if you:

- came back to Australia to live
- started getting Age Pension after you returned
- travel outside Australia during the next 2 years after you returned.

Your payment may be able to continue if you travel to a country we have a [social security agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/which-countries-have-international-social-security-agreements-with-australia) with.

## If you leave Australia for less than 6 weeks

Your Age Pension rate won’t change in most cases.

If you leave Australia for more than 6 weeks

When you reach 6 weeks after leaving Australia your:

- [Pension Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/pension-supplement) will drop to the basic rate
- [Energy Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/energy-supplement) will stop
- Pensioner Concession Card will cancel.

## If you leave Australia for more than 26 weeks

When you reach 26 weeks after leaving Australia your rate will depend on how long you were an [Australian resident](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/residence-descriptions?context=22526) between 16 and [Age Pension age](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/age-pension).

If you were an Australian resident for:

- **35 years** or more, your rate won’t change in most cases
- **less than 35 years**, you’ll get a lower rate in most cases.

For example, if you were a resident for 10 years, you’ll get 10/35ths of your usual rate.

In most cases your rate won’t change if all of these apply. You were:

1. getting Age Pension or another Australian social security payment while living outside Australia on 1 July 2014.
2. an [Australian resident](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/residence-descriptions?context=22526) for **25 years** or more.
3. not in Australia for more than 26 weeks since 1 July 2014, and getting Age Pension the whole time.

Your payment may not reduce or stop if you can’t return to Australia due to unforeseen circumstances. This includes a serious illness, public health crisis or natural disaster. If you have a Pensioner Concession Card, it will still cancel after you’ve been temporarily overseas for 6 weeks.

## If you travel to New Zealand

The [social security agreement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/international-social-security-agreement-between-australia-and-new-zealand) we have with New Zealand can affect your payment.

Your payments may change from the date you arrive in New Zealand if you either:

- go there to live
- plan to be in New Zealand for more than 12 months.

Otherwise your payments may change after you’ve been in New Zealand for 26 weeks.

## If you leave to live in another country

You’ll get an [outside Australia rate](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/payment-schedule-and-rates-for-people-outside-australia?context=22526), and from the date you leave your:

- [Pension Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/pension-supplement) will drop to the basic rate
- [Energy Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/energy-supplement) will stop
- Pensioner Concession Card will cancel.
