# Pensioner Concession Card

A concession card to get cheaper health care, medicines and some discounts if you get certain payments from us.

From December 2025, if you get a new, renewal or replacement card sent to you, it may be either a new laminated card or the older style. Both are a valid proof of concession. The laminated card may seem brighter than the older style card and won’t have hyphens in the CRN.
