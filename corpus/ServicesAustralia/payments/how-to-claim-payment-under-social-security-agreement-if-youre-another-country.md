## Steps to claim an Australian payment

If you’re in another country, complete the following steps to claim Australian payments. Before you start, check if you can get a payment.

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    If you’re in an agreement country and you set up a Centrelink online account linked to myGov before you left Australia, you can claim online. It’s the easiest way to claim.
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=22476) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22476) with us before you start your claim. If you have a partner, they may also need to prove their identity.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If you set up a Centrelink online account linked to myGov before you left Australia, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status** to make a claim.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    If you didn’t set up a myGov account before you left Australia, or you can’t claim online, you can do one of the following:
    
    -   complete the [claim for Australian pension from an agreement country form](/aus140) for the country you’re in
    -   call the social security authorities in that country
    -   call us on the [International services line](#toolbar-phone).
    
3.  ### 3\. Track your claim
    
    If you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you all of the following:
    
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   an estimated completion date
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your application online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status**.

    You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    We’ll let you know the result of your application. We’ll send a message to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online).
    
    If you don't get electronic letters, we'll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details we’ll ask you for them.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).
