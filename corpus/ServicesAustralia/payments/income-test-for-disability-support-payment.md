# Income test

Your income can reduce how much we pay you. We use the pension income test to assess Disability Support Pension (DSP).

## What an income test is

We assess your and your partner’s income from all sources. This includes financial assets such as superannuation if you are over [Age Pension age](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/who-can-get-age-pension#whatagepensionis). To work out how much income your financial assets produce, we use [deeming](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/deeming?context=22276). If you’re paid employment income, read about [working while you’re getting Disability Support Pension](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/working-while-you-get-disability-support-pension-dsp?context=22276).

Pensions have income and asset limits. If you’re over these limits, you get a lower pension.

If you’re permanently blind and get DSP, we don’t use the income test unless you get [Rent Assistance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/rent-assistance).

## What the standard rules are

These are the income rules for most pensioners. Read about the [Work Bonus](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/work-bonus) and how it can help you earn more income from working without reducing your pension when you are over [Age Pension age](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/who-can-get-age-pension#whatagepensionis).

### Single person

| Income per fortnight | Amount your pension will reduce by |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $218 | $0 |
| Over $218 | 50 cents for each dollar over $218 |

### Couple living together or apart due to ill health

| Combined income per fortnight | Amount your combined pension will reduce by |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $380 | $0 |
| Over $380 | 50 cents for each dollar over $380 |

## What the transitional rules are

These are the income rules for [transitional rate pensioners](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/transitional-rate-pension?context=22276), except for DSP customers who at 19 September 2009 met both of the following:

- were younger than 21 years
- had no dependent children.

### Single person

| Income per fortnight is | Amount your pension will reduce by |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $218 | $0 |
| Over $218 | 40 cents for each dollar over $218 |

### Couple living together or apart due to ill health

| Combined income per fortnight | Amount your combined pension will reduce by |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $380 | $0 |
| Over $380 | 40 cents for each dollar over $380 |

### Transitional rate with dependent children

You can earn up to an extra $24.60 per fortnight for each dependent child without reducing your pension. Couples living together and both getting a pension can each earn an extra $12.30 per fortnight for each dependent child.

## What the cut off points are

If your income in a fortnight goes over the cut off point, we’ll pay you $0 for that fortnight.

Your cut off point may be higher if you get [Rent Assistance](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/rent-assistance) or [Work Bonus](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/work-bonus).

Your cut off point may be lower if you don’t live in Australia.

| 21 or older, single | $2,575.40 |
| 21 or older, couple living together | $3,934.00 combined |

| 18 to 20, single, no children, at home | $1,535.20 |

Most types of income count in your income test. We use this and your assets test to assess if you can get a payment, and to calculate your rate of payment.](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/income?context=22276)
