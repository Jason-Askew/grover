# FTB Part A eligibility

We pay Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A per child. The amount we pay you depends on your family’s circumstances.

## on this page

-   [Waiting periods](#a1)
-   [Study requirements](#study)
-   [Other payments](#a3)

You may be eligible for FTB Part A if you care for a dependent child who’s either:

-   0 to 15 years of age
-   16 to 19 years of age and meets the [study requirements](#study).

You must also meet all the following:

-   an [income test](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151)
-   [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151)
-   care for the child at least 35% of the time.

Your child also needs to meet [immunisation requirements](/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=22151) and Healthy Start for School [requirements](/healthy-start-for-school-health-check?context=22151), if they apply. We may reduce your FTB Part A payment per fortnight for each child who doesn’t meet these.

When we [balance your payments](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151) after the financial year you may get a [FTB Part A supplement](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#ftbpartasupplement). If you didn’t get enough FTB during the year, you may also get a top up.

To get the [FTB Part A supplement](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#ftbpartasupplement) your family’s adjusted taxable income must be $80,000 or less.

## Waiting periods

[Newly arrived residents](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22151) generally have to wait one year before getting this payment, with some [exemptions](/exemptions-from-newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22151).

You must continue to meet the [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151) for as long as you get this payment.

## Study requirements

You can only get FTB Part A for children aged 16 to 19 if they meet [study requirements](/family-tax-benefit-when-your-child-16-to-19-and-stops-full-time-study-or-school?context=22151). To meet study requirements they must either:

-   be in full-time secondary study
-   have an acceptable study load
-   have an exemption from us.

## Other payments

If you get FTB Part A you may be eligible for any of the following:

-   [Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement) if you have a baby or adopt a child
-   [FTB Part A Multiple Birth Allowance](/ftb-part-multiple-birth-allowance?context=22151)
-   [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) if you get more than the [base rate of FTB Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#baserate)
-   a [Health Care Card](/health-care-card) if you get the maximum rate of FTB Part A.
