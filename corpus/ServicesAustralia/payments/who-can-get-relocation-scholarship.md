# Who can get it

You might get Relocation Scholarship if you’re a student getting Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY and you meet these rules.

## on this page

-   [Your place of study](#a1)
-   [You can’t get it](#a2)

You must meet all of these rules to get this payment. You:

-   are a [dependent](/dependent-or-independent-for-youth-allowance-student-or-australian-apprentice#dependent) student or an [independent student for a special reason](/relocation-scholarship-for-independent-students?context=22566)
-   study in a specific place
-   meet the [study rules](/study-rules-for-relocation-scholarship?context=22566)
-   get at least $1 of [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices) as a student or [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance).

If you’re an ABSTUDY student but you don’t get any ABSTUDY Living Allowance, you may still be eligible. This is if you get any of these payments from us:

-   [Energy Supplement](/energy-supplement)
-   [Youth Disability Supplement](/youth-disability-supplement).

If you’re eligible to get Relocation Scholarship and you’ve just finished Year 12 or equivalent, you may also be eligible to claim the [Tertiary Access Payment](/tertiary-access-payment). Both payments are available for those moving away from home to study.

## Your place of study

You meet the rule to study in a specific place if you do 1 of the following:

-   move to or from a [regional or remote area](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/custonline_ris/) in Australia to study
-   do approved study overseas for your Australian course
-   do an approved [regional placement](/relocation-scholarship-for-practical-placements?context=22566).

Don’t forget to [tell us if you move](/tell-us-about-changes-if-you-get-relocation-scholarship?context=22566), so we can update your details.

## You can’t get it

You can’t get this payment if any of the following apply:

-   you don’t get Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY
-   you get [ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance](/abstudy-incidentals-allowance) but you don’t get a fortnightly ABSTUDY payment
-   your family home and your place of study are both in a major city when you start studying
-   you get a [Relocation Scholarship](https://www.dva.gov.au/what-we-help-with/education-and-employment/support-for-students/student-start-up-scholarship-and-relocation-scholarship) from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs
-   you get an [Indigenous Student Success Program scholarship](https://www.niaa.gov.au/indigenous-affairs/education/indigenous-student-success-program) from the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) for relocation or accommodation costs.

You may also see the scholarship from the NIAA described as an Indigenous Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarship.

You also can’t get this payment if you live on campus and get [ABSTUDY Residential Costs Option](/abstudy-living-allowance-residential-costs-option). This applies unless you got the offer to live on campus after we paid your scholarship.

Family home location

Where your family home is determines if you can get a Relocation Scholarship and your payment rate in your second and third years of study.
