## Single parent or single carer families

You won’t be eligible for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B if your annual [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=22151) is more than $120,007.

If your income is $120,007 or less, you can get the maximum rate of FTB Part B.

You can get FTB Part B up until the end of the calendar year your youngest child turns 18. If this child is between 16 and 18, they must be in secondary school full-time.

There is separate information for single [grandparent carers](#grandparentcarers).

## Partnered parent or partnered carer families

Partnered parent or partnered carer families can get [FTB Part B](/family-tax-benefit) if the youngest child is younger than 13.

We use a 2 part income test to work out your FTB Part B payment. The primary earner is the parent or non parent carer with the higher income. The secondary earner is the parent or non parent carer with the lower, or no income.

Your family won’t be eligible for FTB Part B if the primary earner earns more than $120,007. If they earn less, we work out how much FTB B your family can get using the secondary earner’s income.

The secondary earner can earn up to $6,935 each year before it affects your FTB Part B payment. Your payments will reduce by 20 cents for each dollar of income earned over $6,935.

You can still get some FTB Part B if the secondary earner’s income is below:

-   $34,438 a year, if the youngest child is younger than 5
-   $26,828 a year, if the youngest child is 5 to 13.

You can’t get FTB Part B on days [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) is paid. If you get FTB Part B fortnightly, we’ll adjust your payments. We do this to make sure we don’t pay you too much FTB Part B.

There is separate information for partnered [grandparent carers](#grandparentcarers).

## Grandparent carers

Grandparent carers can get FTB Part B up until the end of the calendar year their youngest child turns 18. If this child is between 16 and 18, they must be in secondary school full time.

You can get the maximum rate of FTB Part B if both of the following apply:

-   you’re a single grandparent carer
-   your income is $120,007 or less.

For partnered grandparent carers we use a 2 part income test to work out your FTB Part B payment. The primary earner is the grandparent carer with the higher income. The secondary earner is the grandparent carer with the lower income.

You won’t be eligible for FTB Part B if the primary earner earns more than $120,007.

If you’re the secondary earner and your partner earns $120,007 or less, you can still get some FTB Part B. For grandparent carers, this is if your income is below:

-   $34,438 a year, if the youngest child is younger than 5
-   $26,828 a year, if the youngest child is 5 to 18.
