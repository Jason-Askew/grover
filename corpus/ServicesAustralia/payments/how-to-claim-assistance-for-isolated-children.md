# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Assistance for Isolated Children. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim Assistance for Isolated Children

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is to download a claim form and upload it.
    
    If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can upload your form online.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    If you have a nominee they also need to have their own account. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).
    
    You may need to [confirm your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22121) with us before you start your claim.
    
    #### Who can claim
    
    You can claim Assistance for Isolated Children if you have primary or joint care for the child you’re claiming for.
    
    In some cases, we’ll accept a claim if:
    
    -   the child lives with, or is in the care of, a foster parent
    -   the child is in the care of a non-government organisation that has full financial responsibility for them.
    
    Only one parent or guardian can claim.
    
    You need to submit a claim for each child in your care.
    
    #### Who can’t claim
    
    You can’t claim if you’re:
    
    -   the actual child going to school
    -   in prison, or a correctional centre.
    
    A prison or correctional centre may include:
    
    -   detention
    -   a remand or training centre
    -   a psychiatric institution.
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready
    
    You’ll need to get some supporting documents ready. You may need to send some to us as evidence to support your claim. Others will help you answer some of the questions in the claim. Documents you might need include:
    
    -   your tax file number
    -   additional information or evidence requested on the claim form.
    
    #### Marginal Distance Confirmation
    
    If we ask you for evidence about distance or travelling time, complete the [Assistance for Isolated Children Marginal Distance Confirmation form](/sy069).
    
    Complete this form with the person verifying the distances or travelling times.
    
    #### Medical Statement–Student Special Needs
    
    If you’re claiming for a child with special needs, you will need to provide evidence from a medical practitioner. Download the [Assistance for Isolated Children Medical Statement - Student Special Needs form](/sy099).
    
    Complete this form with your doctor or specialist and submit it with your claim if possible.
    
    #### Application for Short Term Boarding Allowance
    
    If your child needs to board away from home for less than a school term, you can apply for periods of short-term boarding allowance. This may be due to a temporary health condition or a lack of access to the local school due to flooding.
    
    If you already get Assistance for Isolated Children Boarding Allowance you can also claim Short Term Boarding Allowance for additional boarding periods during the same year.
    
    Submit the [Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Application for Short Term Boarding Allowance form](/sy068).
    
3.  ### 3\. Submit your claim
    
    If you’re claiming for 2025 you need to submit a claim by 1 March 2026.
    
    If you’re claiming for 2026 you need to submit a claim before 1 March 2027 , but it’s best to submit your claim as soon as possible.
    
    Download and complete the [Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Claim form](/sy040). Then you can [upload documents](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online) in your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) or the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    If you can’t upload your documents online you can print and complete a claim form. Submit it and any supporting documents either:
    
    -   in person at a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
    -   by posting them to the address on the claim form.
    
    Before submitting, it’s important you make sure your name is on your supporting documents so we can identify them.
    
4.  ### 4\. Wait for the results
    
    We’ll tell you:
    
    -   if your claim is successful
    -   when we’ll start paying you
    -   how much you’ll get.
    
    We’ll backdate your payment to when you first became eligible in the study year.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).
