## Family assistance payments

### Family Tax Benefit

#### Fortnightly payments

You can claim for a new child:

- as early as 3 months before the expected date of birth or adoption
- within 52 weeks of the birth or adoption.

For an older child, submit your claim as soon as you think you’re eligible.

You also need to confirm your income so we can [balance your payments](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=60007). You need to do this within 12 months of the end of the financial year.

You can confirm your income by either:

- lodging a tax return
- advising us if you don’t need to lodge one.

If you don’t do this, we’ll send you an [Account Payable notice](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/family-tax-benefit-account-payable-notice?context=60007) for the full amount of FTB you got.

#### Annual lump sum payments

You need to claim [Family Tax Benefit](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/family-tax-benefit) within 12 months of the end of the financial year you’re claiming for.

Read about the [time limits for submitting a lump sum claim](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/time-limits-for-submitting-lump-sum-claims-and-confirming-income-for-family-tax-benefit?context=60007).

### Child Care Subsidy

To get [Child Care Subsidy](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/child-care-subsidy) you need to submit a [claim](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-claim-child-care-subsidy?context=60007). You must be using an approved child care provider. If eligible, we’ll pay the subsidy directly to your provider.

If eligible, we may be able to backdate your subsidy for up to 28 days.

## Paid Parental Leave scheme payments

### Parental Leave Pay

You can claim as early as 3 months before your child’s expected date of birth or adoption.

To get Parental Leave Pay, at least one parent needs to claim within 52 weeks of the child’s birth or adoption. Other parents have 2 years to claim.

To get Parental Leave Pay from your child’s date of birth or adoption, you need to do both of the following within 14 weeks or 100 days of their birth or adoption:

- submit your claim
- provide proof of birth or adoption.

You can read about [claiming timeframes for Parental Leave Pay](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/claiming-timeframes-for-parental-leave-pay).

## Income support payments

### Parenting Payment

You can claim [Parenting Payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/parenting-payment) either after:

- your child is born
- an eligible child comes into your care.

If you’re eligible, we’ll pay you from the date:

- you submit your claim
- your child was born or came into your care, if you submit your claim within 4 weeks.

## Supplement and lump sum payments

### Single Income Family Supplement

You don’t need to claim [Single Income Family Supplement](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/single-income-family-supplement) (SIFS) if you get FTB. If you’re eligible we’ll pay you when we [balance your FTB payments](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=60007).

If you don’t get FTB, you can claim after the end of the financial year. You need to submit your claim and confirm your income within 12 months of the end of the financial year.

### Double Orphan Pension

You should submit your claim for [Double Orphan Pension](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/double-orphan-pension) as soon as possible to be paid from the earliest possible date.

If you’re eligible, we’ll pay you from the date you submit your claim.

We may be able to backdate your payment in some other circumstances. For example, we may pay you from the date of birth of the child if you submit your claim within 13 weeks.

### Stillborn Baby Payment

You have up to 52 weeks to claim the [Stillborn Baby Payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/stillborn-baby-payment). This starts from the date of birth.

We may be able to give you more time if you need it because you either:

- had a severe illness to do with the birth
- applied for Parental Leave Pay but couldn’t receive it.
