# Who can get it

To get this payment, you need to be getting Carer Allowance for a child younger than 16 for a period that includes 1 July.

If you get Carer Allowance for a person between 16 and 18 years old who has a terminal illness you’ll get this payment.

You can’t get Child Disability Assistance Payment if you only have a Carer Allowance Health Care Card.
