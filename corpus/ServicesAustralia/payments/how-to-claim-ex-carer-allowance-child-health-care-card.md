# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim an Ex-Carer Allowance (Child) Health Care Card. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim Ex-Carer Allowance (Child) Health Care Card

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. If you have a correspondence [nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22691) they can also claim for you online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they also need to have their own account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22691).
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=22691) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22691) with us before you start your claim.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
