# Who can get it

You need to meet eligibility requirements to get Farm Household Allowance.

To get Farm Household Allowance (FHA) you must meet all the following:

-   be a farmer or partner of a farmer
-   be 16 years or older
-   contribute labour and capital to an Australian farm, or are the partner of a farmer who does
-   have income and assets below certain amounts
-   have had less than 4 years of FHA in the specific 10-year period.

Your farm must have significant commercial purpose. We’ll assess this based on all the following:

-   the purpose of your farm
-   the prospect for profit
-   consistency of activity
-   whether your farm runs as a business
-   the size, scale and permanency of your farm activity.

If you’ve previously had this payment, you can apply again, but you can only get it for 4 years in a specific 10-year period. Read more about FHA [time limits](/time-limits-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161).
