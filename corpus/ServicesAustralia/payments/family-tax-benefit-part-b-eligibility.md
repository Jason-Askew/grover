# FTB Part B eligibility

We may pay you Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B if you’re a single parent, a grandparent carer, or if you’re a member of a couple with one main income.

## on this page

-   [Study requirements](#studyrequirements)
-   [Other support](#a2)

You may be eligible if either:

-   you’re a member of a couple with one main income and care for a dependent child aged under 13
-   you’re a single parent, or a grandparent carer and care for a dependent child aged under 18. The child must meet [study requirements](#studyrequirements) if they’re aged 16 to 18.

Read more about how we [define a relationship](/getting-together-for-relationship-changes?context=60029).

You must also meet all of the following:

-   an [income test](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part-b?context=22151)
-   [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151)
-   care for the child at least 35% of the time.

You or your partner can’t get FTB Part B on days [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) is paid.

If you’re only getting FTB Part B, you aren’t eligible for Multiple Birth Allowance. You can only get Multiple Birth Allowance if you’re getting [FTB Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-eligibility?context=22151).

## Study requirements

Children 16 to 18 meet the study requirements if any of the following apply to them. They:

-   are in full time secondary study in an approved course leading towards a year 12 or equivalent qualification
-   have an acceptable study load
-   have been granted an exemption from us.

## Other support

There is extra support available if you’re caring for your grandchildren. Read more about [support for grandparent carers](/support-for-grandparent-carers?context=22151).

There’s also other payments and services available for non parent carers. Read more about [support for non parent carers](/support-for-foster-carers-and-other-non-parent-carers).
