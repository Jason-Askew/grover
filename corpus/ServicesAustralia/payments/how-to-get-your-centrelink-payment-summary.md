# How to get it

You can use a self service option to get your payment summary.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in from early July to view, download or ask for a copy of your Centrelink payment summary. If it’s not available, it might be delayed due to an error identified in some payment summaries.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/express-plus-mobile-apps). To do this, sign in to the app and select **More**, then **Statements**.

You can also use:

- self service terminals at some [service centres](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
- the **request a document** prompt when you call the [Centrelink phone self service](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/centrelink-phone-self-service).

Family Tax Benefit is a non-taxable payment. If you only got payments of Family Tax Benefit from us, you won’t get a payment summary.

## When to lodge your tax return

Your payment summary information should pre-fill in your ATO tax return by mid-July. Other income and information should pre-fill in your tax return by late July. It’s best to lodge your tax return once all your information pre-fills and your income statement from any employer is marked as **tax ready**. This will help you avoid errors and having to amend and re-submit it again later.

If you can access your payment summary and your payment information hasn’t pre-filled into your tax return by late July, you can add it in yourself. Use the details on your payment summary to fill in your tax return.
