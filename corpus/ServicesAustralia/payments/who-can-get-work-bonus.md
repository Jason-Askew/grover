# Who can get it

You must meet eligibility requirements to get the Work Bonus.

You can get the Work Bonus if you are of Age Pension age and you get one of these payments:

-   [Age Pension](/who-can-get-age-pension#whatagepensionis)
-   [Carer Payment](/working-while-you-get-carer-payment)
-   [Disability Support Pension](/working-while-you-get-disability-support-pension-dsp).

Each payment has different rules. If you get Carer Payment or Disability Support Pension, you still need to meet the normal work rules for those payments.

If you’re getting the [transitional rate of pension](/transitional-rate-pension), you’re not eligible for the Work Bonus.

You can use your Centrelink online account through myGov to see your Work Bonus balance.
