# Who can get it

You’ll automatically get the Youth Disability Supplement if you’re under 21, and you get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

Read more about [DSP](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension).

You may also get it if you're under 22 and get either:

-   [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance) as a job seeker, full time student or Australian Apprentice, or
-   [ABSTUDY](/abstudy) as a full time student or Australian Apprentice.

If you’re getting Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY you also need a current [Employment Services Assessment](/employment-services-assessments). It must show that you have an illness, injury or disability that both:

-   stops you from working 30 or more hours a week
-   will last more than 2 years.

We’ll refer you for an Employment Services Assessment if you need one.
