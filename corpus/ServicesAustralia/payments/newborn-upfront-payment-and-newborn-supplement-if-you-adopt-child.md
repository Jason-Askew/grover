# You adopt a child

If you're adopting a child, you may be eligible for Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement.

This is if both of the following apply:

-   the child of any age is placed in your or your partner's care by an authorised party as part of the adoption process
-   you become eligible for [FTB Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-eligibility) within 12 months of the child coming into your or your partner's care.
