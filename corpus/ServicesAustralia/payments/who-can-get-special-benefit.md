# Who can get it

You may get Special Benefit if you’re not eligible for any other income support and you meet the eligibility rules.

## on this page

-   [Eligibility rules for you](#a1)
-   [Eligibility rules for a child](#a2)

The eligibility rules depend on whether you’re applying for yourself or applying for a child.
