# Crisis Payment

A one-off non-taxable payment if you’ve experienced an extreme circumstance and are in severe financial hardship.

There are different types of Crisis Payments for different extreme circumstances.

We consider an extreme circumstance to be one of the following:

- you experienced an incident of family and domestic violence that forced you to leave your home
- you stayed in your home after experiencing domestic violence and the family member responsible left or was removed from the home
- you were forced to leave your home because of a circumstance and it’s unreasonable for you to return to your home in the near future
- you arrived in Australia as a humanitarian entrant for the first time
- you were in prison or psychiatric confinement for a period of at least 14 days.

Each type of Crisis Payment has its own eligibility criteria.

Select the Crisis Payment for your situation to find out more information.
