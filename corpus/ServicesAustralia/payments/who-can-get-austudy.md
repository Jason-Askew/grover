# Who can get it

You need to meet certain criteria to get Austudy if you're a student or Australian Apprentice.

## on this page

-   [Students](#a1)
-   [Apprentices](#a2)
-   [Meet some of our students](#a3)

You’ll need to meet all of the following:

-   residence rules
-   an income test
-   an assets test.

If you’re getting Youth Allowance as a student or Australian Apprentice at the time you turn 25, you won’t move to Austudy. You’ll keep getting Youth Allowance until you finish your current course or apprenticeship.

Austudy is an income support payment. If you get a different income support payment it will stop when your Austudy payments start.

You may not be eligible if you get certain payments from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). Read more about [getting a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) payment](/getting-department-veterans-affairs-dva-payment?context=22441).
