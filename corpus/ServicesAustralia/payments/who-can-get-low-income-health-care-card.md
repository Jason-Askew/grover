# Who can get a card

To get a Low Income Health Care Card your income needs to be below the income test limit.

You don’t need to pass an assets test.

## Children on your card

If your child’s name is on your card you may be able to use it for their expenses.

We can put your dependent child on your card if either:

-   you’re their main carer
-   they live with you for at least 2 nights every fortnight.

They must be younger than 19 if you’re supporting them while they study.
