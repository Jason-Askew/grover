# How to claim

Check if you’re eligible before you start your claim. If you get Family Tax Benefit, you don’t need to claim Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS).

To be eligible for this payment, you must have been eligible on 30 June 2017 and stayed eligible since. Read more about [who can get this](/who-can-get-single-income-family-supplement?context=22211).

If you’re eligible we’ll pay you after you and your partner either:

-   lodge a tax return with the Australian Tax Office (ATO)
-   tell us you don’t need to lodge and confirm your income with us.

If you don’t get [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) you may still be eligible for SIFS. You can submit a claim for SIFS after the end of the financial year.
