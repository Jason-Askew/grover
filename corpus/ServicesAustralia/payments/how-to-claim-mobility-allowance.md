# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Mobility Allowance.

Before you start, check if you [can get it](/who-can-get-mobility-allowance?context=22501).

## Steps to claim Mobility Allowance

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. You can’t get Mobility Allowance if you have a plan with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22501).
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22501) with us before you start your claim.
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    You’ll need to give [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-mobility-allowance-claim?context=22501) as part of your claim. This includes a:
    
    -   [medical report from your doctor](/ma002) to tell us why you can’t use public transport
    -   proof of hours you are working or training.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can apply online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to myGov.
    2.  Select **Make a claim or view claim status**, then **Make a claim**.
    3.  Under **Disabled, ill or injury** select **Get started**.
    4.  Select **Apply for Mobility Allowance** then follow the prompts to complete your claim.

    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    If you can’t claim online, you can do one of the following:
    
    -   print and complete the [Claim for Mobility Allowance form](/ma001)
    -   call us on the [Disability, carers and sickness line](#toolbar-phone)
    -   visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).
    
4.  ### 4\. After you claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you:
    
    -   your claim was submitted
    -   the ID number of your claim.
    
    We’ll let you know the result of your application. We’ll send a message to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online).
    
    If you don’t get electronic letters, we’ll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details we’ll ask you for them.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).
