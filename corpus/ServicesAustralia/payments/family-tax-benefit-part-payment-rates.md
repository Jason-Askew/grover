## How we work out your payment rate

You need to keep your [family income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=22151) up to date so we pay you the right amount.

We pay Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A for each eligible child. We work out your payment rate by doing both of the following:

-   using your [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=22151) and an [income test](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151)
-   looking at the ages and number of children in your care.

If you share caring responsibilities for a child, we use your percentage of care to work out your rate.

You or your partner may have a child from a previous relationship in your care. If this is the case, you need to meet the [Maintenance Action Test](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151#actiontest). You need to meet this test to get more than the [base rate of FTB Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#baserate). This applies to your partner too.

Any child support you get may affect your payment rate. Read more about [how child support affects FTB Part A](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151).

Your child may also need to meet [immunisation](/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=22151) and [Healthy Start for School](/healthy-start-for-school-health-check?context=22151) requirements.

If they don’t, we may reduce your FTB Part A payments.

We’ll contact you if your child isn’t meeting these requirements. We’ll let you know what you need to do before we reduce your payments.

Use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see how much FTB Part A you may be eligible for.

## What the base rate is

The base rate for FTB Part A is $72.94 for each child per fortnight.

The base rate isn’t the minimum rate of FTB Part A. We may pay you less than the base rate. For example, you may get less due to your [income](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151).

## What the maximum rate is

The maximum rate for FTB Part A depends on the age of the child you get it for.

The maximum rate for each child per fortnight is:

-   $227.36 for a child 0 to 12 years
-   $295.82 for a child 13 to 15 years
-   $295.82 for a [child 16 to 19 years who meets the study requirements](/family-tax-benefit-when-your-child-16-to-19-and-stops-full-time-study-or-school?context=22151).

## What the FTB Part A supplement rate is

If you get FTB Part A, you may also get the FTB Part A supplement. It’s a yearly payment.

If you’re eligible, you’ll get it after we [balance your payments](/balancing-your-family-assistance-payments). We do this after the end of the financial year.

For the 2024-25 financial year, it’s a payment of up to $916.15 for each eligible child.

For the 2025-26 financial year, it’s a payment of up to $938.05 for each eligible child. The amount we’ll pay you depends on all of the following:

-   how many children you have in your care
-   if you share care
-   your family’s income
-   the number of days you were eligible for FTB Part A.
