Primary victim

A primary victim is a person who was harmed as a direct result of a declared overseas terrorist act.

For primary victim claims, we consider all of the following:

-   the nature of the injury or disease suffered as a direct result of the terrorist act
-   the effect of the injury or disease on the person’s life
-   if the person failed to take reasonable steps to avoid harm or acted recklessly when the terrorist act occurred
-   if there was travel advice on an Australian Government website advising against travelling to the foreign country, region or place where the terrorist act occurred
-   if the person was directed by an official of Australia or a foreign country to leave or not go to the place where the terrorist act occurred
-   if the person was in the place where the terrorist act occurred for a humanitarian purpose
-   if the person was in the place where the terrorist act occurred on official business for the government of the Commonwealth, a state or territory
-   if the person has received financial assistance from a foreign country.

Secondary victim

A secondary victim is a close family member of a person who died as a direct result of a declared overseas terrorist act.

AVTOP is shared between the eligible secondary victims who claim. We consider if any of the following apply:

-   the person has made a claim as a secondary victim of the terrorist act for another close family member
-   the close family member failed to take reasonable steps to avoid harm or acted recklessly when the terrorist act occurred
-   there was travel advice on an Australian Government website advising against travelling to the foreign country, region or place where the terrorist act occurred

-   the person claiming, other secondary victims or the close family member has received financial assistance from a foreign country for the event or death of the close family member
-   the close family member received AVTOP as a primary victim
-   the close family member died as a direct result of the declared terrorist act within 2 years of the event.

In the place

For this payment, in the place means you experienced the terrorist act first-hand.

Experiencing the terrorist act first-hand means being present, and personally experiencing the terrorist act direct from the original source.

Harmed includes any physical or psychological injury suffered as a direct result of the declared overseas terrorist act.

Close family member

A close family member of the victim at the time of the declared overseas terrorist act, is any of the following:

-   partner
-   child
-   parent, including legal guardian
-   sibling.

Legal guardian

A legal guardian is someone who’s been granted guardianship of a child. It can be granted to a single person, or jointly with another person or persons.

Guardianship is granted under the law:

-   of the Commonwealth
-   of a state or territory.
