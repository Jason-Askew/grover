# Who can get it

If you or your family pay private health insurance premiums, you may be eligible for the Australian Government Rebate.

Most people with private health insurance can claim the rebate as an upfront reduction on their private health insurance premium. We pay the rebate to your insurer and the insurer reduces your premium.

If you don’t claim the rebate as a reduction to your premium you can claim it through your tax return. You may be able to claim it as a tax offset in your annual income tax return.

You may get a reduced premium if your health insurance policy covers either or both:

-   hospital
-   general treatment - also known as ancillary or extras.

You must be eligible for Medicare and the policy must cover you to get the rebate. You must also meet the income thresholds.

[

Medicare levy surcharge

If you don’t have private health insurance, you may have to pay a surcharge. This is only if your income is more than the Medicare levy surcharge threshold.
