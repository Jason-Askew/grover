# Who can get it

You need to meet eligibility requirements to get Family Tax Benefit (FTB).

There are two parts to FTB:

-   Part A
-   Part B

We pay FTB Part A per child. Read more about [FTB Part A eligibility](/family-tax-benefit-part-eligibility?context=22151).

We pay FTB Part B for a variety of family circumstances. Read more about [FTB Part B eligibility](/family-tax-benefit-part-b-eligibility?context=22151).

We use your adjusted taxable income to decide if you can get FTB. Read more about [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=22151) or [how we use adjusted taxable income](/how-we-use-adjusted-taxable-income?context=22151).

You must meet certain [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151) to get FTB Part A and Part B.

If you can’t get FTB, you may be able to get [other payments](/get-centrelink-payment).
