# Shared care and blended families

If you share the care of your child or have a blended family your payment amount depends on your circumstances.

## Shared care

If you share the care of your child, both carers may be eligible for Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement. The amount each of you gets depends on your circumstances.

## Blended families

If you get FTB Part A as a blended family, we’ll pay you based on the FTB percentage you get. This is for both Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement.

A blended family is a family with 2 or more dependent children. This can be a blend of children from a previous relationship or from your current relationship.

Of the dependent children, 1 must be a child of 1 member of the couple, from a previous relationship. And 1 must be a child of either:

-   your current relationship
-   the other member of the couple, from a previous relationship.
