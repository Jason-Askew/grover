# Multiple children

If you have twins, triplets, quadruplets or more, you may get Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement.

If you have twins, triplets, quadruplets or more, you can get both:

-   Newborn Upfront Payment, as a lump sum of $667 per child
-   Newborn Supplement, at a maximum rate of $2,003.82 per child.

You may also get these payments if both the following apply:

-   you adopt multiple children as part of the same adoption process
-   multiple children younger than 12 months old come into your or your partner’s care as part of the same process.

If you get [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) you cannot get Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement for the same child.

You can only get Parental Leave Pay for one child in each multiple birth or multiple adoption process. If you’re sharing Parental Leave Pay, you and the other parent need to claim Parental Leave Pay for the same child. You can get Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement for the other child or children.

## Multiple Birth Allowance

Depending on your circumstances, you may also be eligible for [Multiple Birth Allowance](/ftb-part-multiple-birth-allowance). You can get this if you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A and you care for any of the following:

-   triplets
-   quadruplets or more.

If you’re a parent of twins, you can’t get Multiple Birth Allowance.
