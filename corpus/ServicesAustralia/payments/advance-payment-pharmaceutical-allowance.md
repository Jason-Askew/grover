# Advance payment

You may be able to get Pharmaceutical Allowance in advance as a lump sum of 7 fortnightly payments.

You can apply if you get either:

-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) single and are under Age Pension age
-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension) and are under 21 with no dependent children.

But your income, not including your Centrelink payments or maintenance income, must be less than either:

-   $20.50 a fortnight
-   $41.00 a fortnight combined income if you have a partner.

The amount you have spent on Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme prescription medicines also matters. It must be more than the Pharmaceutical Allowance you have been paid this calendar year.

## How to claim an advance payment

Call us or go to a service centre and ask for a **Claim for Advance of Pharmaceutical Allowance SA140** form.

You need to provide your Pharmaceutical Benefits Prescription Record when you claim.

You can only claim in person at a service centre. You may be asked to confirm your identity while you’re there.

We’ll write to you and let you know:

-   if we accept your claim
-   when we’ll pay you
-   how much you’ll get.

You have the right to appeal our decision. Read about [reviews and appeals](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).
