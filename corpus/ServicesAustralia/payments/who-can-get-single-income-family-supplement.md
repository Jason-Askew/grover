# Who can get it

You must meet certain criteria to receive Single Income Family Supplement (SIFS).

You may be eligible if all of the following apply:

-   you were eligible on 30 June 2017 and have stayed eligible since
-   there is 1 main income earner in your family
-   their taxable income is between $68,000 and $150,000
-   you receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for at least 1 child.

If you have another income earner in your family their taxable income must be less than $18,000.

You may also be eligible for SIFS if you would be eligible for FTB, except that your family’s income is too high, or your child is getting the at home rate of 1 of these payments:

-   Disability Support Pension
-   Youth Allowance
-   Special Benefit
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   an education allowance under the Veterans’ Children Education Scheme
-   an education allowance under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme.

To get SIFS, you need to have been eligible on 30 June 2017 and stayed eligible since. You won’t get it again if there’s a break in your eligibility. This may happen if one of the following apply. You:

-   no longer care for an eligible child
-   leave Australia for more than 6 weeks with your child
-   care for the child less than 35% of the time
-   have too much income
-   don’t lodge a tax return or tell us you don’t need to lodge one in time
-   don’t submit a claim in time.
