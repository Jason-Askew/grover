# Who can get it

You may be able to get Stillborn Baby Payment if you recently had a baby who was stillborn.

## on this page

-   [How we define stillbirth for our payments](#a1)
-   [Income test](#incometest)

You may be able to get this payment if all of the following apply:

-   you recently had a baby who was stillborn
-   you or your partner would have been the baby’s main carer
-   you don’t get [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) for the same baby
-   you meet the [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-stillborn-baby-payment?context=22221) about living in Australia
-   you meet an [income test](#incometest).

You can’t get Stillborn Baby Payment and [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) for the same baby.

## How we define stillbirth for our payments

To be eligible for our payments, a stillbirth needs to meet our definition. A stillborn baby is one who had not breathed since delivery and had no heartbeat after birth.

To be considered stillborn, a baby also had to have a gestation period of at least 20 weeks or weighed at least 400 grams at their birth.

## Income test

To get this payment, you need to meet an income test. The income test uses your family’s [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income). We ask what you expect this to be for the 6 months after your baby’s birth.

The limit is an income of $77,177.00 in the 6 months after your baby’s birth.
