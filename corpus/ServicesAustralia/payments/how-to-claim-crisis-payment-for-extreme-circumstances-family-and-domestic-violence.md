## Steps to claim a Crisis Payment for extreme circumstances family and domestic violence

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    As part of the claim process, you have to speak with a social worker. They will ask you for both:
    
    -   evidence of the extreme circumstance
    -   permission to contact someone else who can confirm your circumstances.
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. To do this, you’ll need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they can claim online for you, but they’ll need to have their own myGov account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=52755).
    
    You can also prepare supporting documents before you claim.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can claim online.
