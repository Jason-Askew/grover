You’ll need to meet all of these:

You may not be eligible if you get certain payments from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). Read more about [getting a DVA payment](/getting-department-veterans-affairs-dva-payment?context=51411).

You can use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to help check if you can get a payment.

## Unemployed and looking for work

You may get JobSeeker Payment if any of the following apply:

-   you’re unemployed
-   you’re not in full time work, for example you’re doing part time or casual work
-   you’ve been temporarily stood down
-   you’ve had your work hours reduced.

If you earn income over a certain amount, it will affect how much JobSeeker Payment you can get. Read more about [income tests](/income-and-assets-tests-for-jobseeker-payment?context=51411).

## Sick or injured and can’t do your usual work or study

You may be sick or injured, which stops you from doing your usual work or study for a short time. In this case, you may get JobSeeker Payment. You’ll need to meet certain rules and give us a medical certificate.

## Other support you can get

You may be able to get other support as well as JobSeeker Payment.

If you do a SEE course, you may be able to get the [Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement](/language-literacy-and-numeracy-supplement).
