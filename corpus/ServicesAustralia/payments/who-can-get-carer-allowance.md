# Who can get it

To get this payment, both you and the person you care for need to meet some rules.

As the carer, you’ll need to:

-   meet [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-carer-allowance?context=21811)
-   provide daily care and attention to someone who needs it in their home, or your home.

There’s no assets test for Carer Allowance but there’s an income test. To get this payment your and your partner’s combined [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=21811) must be less than $250,000 per financial year. This amount is before tax. There’s no income test for the person you care for.

If you care for someone younger than 16 years, we’ll send you a [Health Care Card](/health-care-card). This helps with the costs of their medicine and health care.

We’ll assess your eligibility and the [person you care for](/carer-allowance-rules-for-person-you-care-for?context=21811). If you don’t think you meet these rules, there are [other payments and supports](/getting-support-if-youre-caring-for-someone) available for you.
