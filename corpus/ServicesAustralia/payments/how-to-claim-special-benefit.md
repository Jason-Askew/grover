# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Special Benefit. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim Special Benefit

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.
    
    To do this, you’ll need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a correspondence nominee or [someone to act for you](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22281), they can claim online for you, but they’ll need to have their own account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov or Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22281).
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    During your claim, we’ll ask you to give us some documents to support your claim. These depend on your situation and the questions we need to ask you.
    
    Check that you have the right [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-special-benefit?context=22281) ready to go with your claim. We can’t process your claim until we have all the required documents.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can apply online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to myGov.
    2.  Select **Make a claim or view claim status**, then **Make a claim**.
    3.  Under **Other payments** select **Get started**.
    4.  Select **Apply for Special Benefit** then follow the prompts to complete your claim.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    You can call us on the [Centrelink Employment Services line](#toolbar-phone).
    
    If you prefer to speak to someone in your own language, call the [Centrelink Multilingual phone service](#toolbar-phone) and ask to speak to an interpreter.
    
    If you’re a non-resident parent or guardian claiming on behalf of an Australian citizen or permanent resident child, you must fill in and return the [Claim for Special Benefit for a child form](/su721).
    
    Make sure you attach all the supporting documents we ask for. This may include some [other related forms you may need to complete](/other-forms-you-may-need-to-complete-special-benefit?context=22281).
    
4.  ### 4\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt. It’ll tell you:
    
    -   you submitted your claim
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   a link you need to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your claim online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status**.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    We’ll let you know the result of your application. We’ll send a message to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online) or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.
    
    If you don’t get electronic letters, we’ll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details, we’ll ask you for them.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews-centrelink-decision).
