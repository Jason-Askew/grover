## Steps to claim an Australian payment

Complete the following steps to claim Australian payments when you’re in Australia. Before you start, check if you can get a payment.

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22476).
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=22476) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22476) with us before you start your claim. If you have a partner, they may also need to prove their identity.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in and select **Make a claim** or **view claim status to make a claim**.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    If you can’t claim online, talk to us. Our staff will ask you some questions and help you with your claim. You can either:
    
    -   go to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
    -   [call us](/phone-us) on the payment line you’re claiming for.
    
3.  ### 3\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you all of the following:
    
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   an estimated completion date
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your application online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim** or **view claim status**.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    We’ll let you know the result of your application. We’ll send a message to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online).
    
    If you don't get electronic letters, we'll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details we’ll ask you for them.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).
    

## Claim a payment from another country

If you’re in Australia, you can claim a payment from another country.

You can claim by either:

-   calling the [International services line](/phone-us#internationalservices)
-   calling the social security authorities in that country
-   visiting a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).
