# Who can get it

If you're a student getting Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY Living Allowance, you might be able to get a Student Start-up Loan.

To get the Student Start-up Loan, you must do all of the following:

-   get at least $1 of [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance) as a student, [Austudy](/austudy) or [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance)
-   tell us your Tax File Number
-   meet the [study rules](/study-rules-for-student-start-up-loan?context=23316)
-   apply during the [loan period](/student-start-up-loan-periods-and-payments?context=23316) and at least 35 days before your course ends.

If you’re an ABSTUDY student but you don’t get any ABSTUDY Living Allowance, you may still be eligible. This is if you get any of these payments from us:

-   [Energy Supplement](/energy-supplement)
-   [Youth Disability Supplement](/youth-disability-supplement).

## Who can’t get it

You can’t get a Student Start-up Loan if any of the following apply:

-   you don’t get Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY
-   you get [ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance](/abstudy-incidentals-allowance) but you don’t get a fortnightly ABSTUDY payment
-   you get the Pensioner Education Supplement
-   you haven’t told us your Tax File Number

-   you get an [Indigenous Student Success Program scholarship](https://www.niaa.gov.au/indigenous-affairs/education/indigenous-student-success-program) from the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) to help with education costs.

The scholarship from the NIAA may also be known as an Indigenous Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarship.
