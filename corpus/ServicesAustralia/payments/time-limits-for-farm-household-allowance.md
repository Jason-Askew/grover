# Time limits

You can only get Farm Household Allowance (FHA) for a set period.

You can get FHA for 4 years in specific 10-year periods.

The first 10-year period was 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024.

The next 2 periods are:

-   1 July 2024 to 30 June 2034
-   1 July 2034 to 30 June 2044.

You can test your eligibility for FHA by lodging a claim. You can do this online using your Centrelink online account.

You don’t have to use your 4 years of FHA all at once. You can save it for when you need it.

Once you use your 4 years in a 10-year period, your payment stops. You can apply again at the start of the next 10-year period.

This is a video about Stacey and David, and what reclaiming meant to them.

If you were receiving FHA as one 10-year period ended and the current 10-year period began, you would have been given the choice to opt out of receiving the payment. If you didn’t opt out, your payment continued and your FHA payment for up to 4 years restarted from 1 July 2024.
