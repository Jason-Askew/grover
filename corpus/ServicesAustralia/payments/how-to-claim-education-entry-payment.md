# How to claim

What you may need to do to claim Education Entry Payment (EdEP).

How you claim EdEP depends on the payment you’re getting.

We’ll automatically pay EdEP if you either:

-   transfer to a student payment
-   claim [Pensioner Education Supplement](/pensioner-education-supplement).

If you haven’t been paid EdEP with your transfer, call the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone) to see if you’re eligible.

If you get JobSeeker Payment or Parenting Payment, you need to let us know when your course starts to claim EdEP. You can do this by either:

-   calling your usual payment line
-   recording it on your Workforce Australia homepage through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/), if you’re a job seeker registered with [Workforce Australia](https://workforceaustralia.gov.au/) Online.

If you continue studying and don’t get EdEP in another 12 months’ time, you may need to call us.

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
