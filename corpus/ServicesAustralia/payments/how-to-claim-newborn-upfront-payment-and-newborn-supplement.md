# How to claim

When you claim Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for your child we’ll check if you’re eligible for Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement.

We’ll only do this if you don’t receive Parental Leave Pay for the child.

You can apply for FTB up to 3 months before your child's expected date of birth or adoption.
