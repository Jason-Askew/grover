# Parental leave and the Fair Work Ombudsman

The Fair Work Ombudsman can help you understand your unpaid parental leave entitlements under the Fair Work Act.

Under the [National Employment Standards](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment-conditions/national-employment-standards) you could be entitled to unpaid parental leave. This is if you’ve been employed by your current employer for 12 months or more before the birth or adoption of a child.

If your registered workplace agreement includes paid parental leave entitlements, the Fair Work Ombudsman can also help you understand this.

Learn more about the rules and entitlements that apply before, during and after [parental leave](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/parental-leave) on the Fair Work Ombudsman website.
