# FTB Part B payment rates

The amount of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B we’ll pay you depends on the age of your youngest child and your income.

## How we work out your payment rate

You need to keep your [family income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=22151) up to date so we pay you the right amount.

We pay Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part B per family. We work out your payment rate using your [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=41186) and an [income test](/income-test-for-family-tax-benefit-part-b?context=22151).

If you share caring responsibilities for a child, we use your percentage of care to work out your rate.

Your payment rate may change if you’re a [parent returning to work](#parents).

Use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see how much FTB Part B you may be eligible for.

## What is the maximum rate

The maximum rate for FTB Part B depends on the age of your youngest child.

The maximum rate per family each fortnight is:

-   $193.34 when the youngest child is 0 to 4 years of age
-   $134.96 when the youngest child is 5 to 18 years of age.

### Parents returning to work

Parents who start or return to work for the first time after taking time off to care for a newborn child or a child that has come into their care may be eligible for extra assistance.

If you’re eligible, you’ll be paid the maximum rate of FTB Part B for the period of the financial year before you or your partner commenced or returned to work.

We’ll pay you once we confirm your actual annual income. We’ll get these details when we either:

-   [balance your payments](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151)
-   finalise your FTB lump sum claim.

You may get the maximum rate if the person returning to work is:

-   the lower income earner in the couple
-   starting or returning to work for the first time after your child’s birth or since they entered your care.

You cannot get FTB Part B during any period when you or your partner get Parental Leave Pay.

Once you benefit from the FTB Part B return to work period, you would only benefit from future return to work periods if another eligible child enters your care. You need to tell us you’ve returned to work. You need to do this within 12 months from the end of the financial year you returned to work.

## What is the FTB Part B supplement rate

If you get FTB Part B, you may also get the FTB Part B supplement. It’s a yearly payment.

If you’re eligible, you’ll get it after we [balance your payments](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151). We do this after the end of the financial year.

For the 2024-25 financial year, it’s a payment of up to $448.95 per family.

For the 2025-26 financial year, it’s a payment of up to $459.90 per family.

The amount we’ll pay you depends on:

-   if you share care
-   your family’s income
-   the number of days you were eligible for FTB Part B.
