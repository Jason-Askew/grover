# Who can get it

Learn who can get Education Entry Payment (EdEP).

## on this page

-   [If you get a payment with no time requirement](#notimerequirement)
-   [If you get a payment with a 12 month time requirement](#12monthrequirement)
-   [If you’re transferring to a student payment](#transferring)

To get EdEP, you need to be doing [approved study or training](/approved-study-or-training-for-education-entry-payment?context=22146) and get certain payments from us. Your eligibility will depend on the payment that you get.

## If you get a payment with no time requirement

You can get EdEP if you study while you get [Pensioner Education Supplement](/pensioner-education-supplement) and one of the following payments:

-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) single
-   [Special Benefit](/special-benefit) if you’re a single principal carer and are not eligible for parenting payments.

It’s doesn’t matter how long you’ve been getting these payments for. You’ll get EdEP automatically [once each calendar year as a recurring payment](/how-much-education-entry-payment-you-can-get?context=22146#onceayear) while you study.

## If you get a payment with a 12 month time requirement

You may get EdEP if you’ve been getting either of the following payments for the last 12 months:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment), including if you transferred from another income support payment
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) partnered, including if you transferred from [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) single.

You can get a maximum of [one EdEP every rolling 12 months](/how-much-education-entry-payment-you-can-get?context=22146#rolling12months). You’ll need to let us know when you start studying an approved course.

## If you’re transferring to a student payment

Your situation or the course you’re studying may mean you have to transfer to one of the following student payments:

-   [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices) for students
-   [ABSTUDY](/abstudy)
-   [Austudy](/austudy).

You may get EdEP when you transfer if you’ve been getting one of the following payments for 12 months:

-   an [eligible payment with no time requirement](/who-can-get-education-entry-payment?context=22146#notimerequirement)
-   an [eligible payment with a 12 month requirement](/who-can-get-education-entry-payment?context=22146#12monthrequirement).

You’ll get EdEP [once only at the start of your course](/how-much-education-entry-payment-you-can-get?context=22146#getsitonceonly).
