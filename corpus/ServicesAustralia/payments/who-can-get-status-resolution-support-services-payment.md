# Who can get it

You may be able to get this payment if you’re unable to support yourself while resolving your immigration status.

The Department of Home Affairs will tell us if you are eligible for this payment. You should read about eligibility on the [Department of Home Affairs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa/visa-about-to-expire-or-expired/status-resolution-service/status-resolution-support-services-program) website.

If the Department of Home Affairs decides you are eligible they will let us know we can pay you.
