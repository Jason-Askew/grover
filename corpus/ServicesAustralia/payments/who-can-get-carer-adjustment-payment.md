# Who can get it

To get this payment there are rules you need to meet.

A doctor will need to diagnose your child with a severe medical condition or disability following a catastrophic event. You must claim within 2 years from the first time a doctor diagnoses your child’s condition.

You’ll also need to:

-   be getting [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance) for your child
-   have a very strong need for financial help
-   provide full time care for at least 2 months following the catastrophic event.

To get this one-off payment, you and your partner must not be eligible to get an [income support payment](/income-support-payment?context=60271) from us.

If you or your partner becomes eligible for an income support payment after the catastrophic event you still may be able to claim Carer Adjustment Payment. You can lodge a claim for the period between the event and when the income support payment was paid.
