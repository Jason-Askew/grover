# How to claim

You can claim Away from Base Assistance in different ways, depending on what you need to claim for. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## on this page

-   [If your education provider arranges your meals, accommodation and travel](#a1)
-   [If your education provider arranges some or none of your meals, accommodation and travel](#a2)

You must be eligible for ABSTUDY Living Allowance or ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance to get the assistance. You need to first claim [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance) or [ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance](/abstudy-additional-incidentals-allowance), even if your education provider is claiming Away from Base Assistance on your behalf.

## If your education provider arranges your meals, accommodation and travel

If your education provider arrange all your meals, accommodation and travel, you don’t need to claim assistance from us. Your education provider will do this on your behalf. When they arrange the meals and accommodation, we call this a residential expenses package.

## If your education provider arranges some or none of your meals, accommodation and travel

If you pay for your own meals, accommodation or travel, you can claim the costs from us. You can claim a daily allowance for your meals and accommodation before or after your activity.

If your education provider doesn’t arrange your travel, you can claim [ABSTUDY Fares Allowance](/how-to-claim-abstudy-fares-allowance).

You can claim Away from Base Assistance either:

-   [before your activity](/claiming-away-from-base-assistance-before-your-activity?context=53534)
-   [after your activity](/claiming-away-from-base-assistance-after-your-activity?context=53534).

If you need help, call the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).
