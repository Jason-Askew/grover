# Who can get it

You need to meet some requirements to get Child Care Subsidy (CCS).

We pay this subsidy directly to your child care provider to reduce the fees you pay.

You may be eligible if you or your partner meet all of the following:

-   care for your child at least 2 nights per fortnight or have 14% care
-   are liable for fees for care provided at an approved child care service
-   meet the [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186).

Your child must also meet both of these:

-   [immunisation requirements](/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=41186)
-   not be attending secondary school unless an exemption applies.

If your child attends secondary school, you may still be eligible if they need supervision. They must be either:

-   13 or under
-   14 to 18 with disability.

In these circumstances, you must provide evidence why your child can’t be unsupervised. This may include evidence of your child’s disability and if exceptional circumstances apply. You also need to confirm an adult cannot care for your child during this time.

If we ask you to provide a statutory declaration, it must be a Commonwealth statutory declaration. Find out about [Commonwealth statutory declarations](https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/statutory-declarations#ways-to-make-a-commonwealth-statutory-declaration) on the Attorney-General’s Department website.

Each person that’s liable to pay child care fees will need to apply for this subsidy and meet these criteria.

Find out more about how to maintain your eligibility for CCS [when your child doesn’t use child care](/child-care-subsidy-if-your-child-absent-from-child-care?context=41186#whenyourchilddoesntusechildcare).

## Extra support

Some families can get [Additional Child Care Subsidy](/additional-child-care-subsidy). We pay it on top of CCS to provide extra support with child care fees.

There are 3 different types of Additional Child Care Subsidy that you can apply for. You can apply if you’re either:

-   a grandparent
-   transitioning to work from certain income support payments
-   experiencing temporary financial hardship.

Families who need help with the cost of child care to support their child’s safety and wellbeing can get Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing). You should talk your child care service about your circumstances and if Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) is right for you.

### Approved child care

These are services that have Australian Government approval to get CCS on your behalf to reduce your fees. Approved child care includes:

-   Centre Based Day Care, including long day care and occasional care
-   Family Day Care
-   Outside School Hours Care, including before, after and vacation care
-   In Home Care.

#### In Home Care

The eligibility criteria for In Home Care is different. You need to meet all eligibility criteria for CCS and extra criteria. You can find out more about [In Home Care](https://www.education.gov.au/early-childhood/about-early-childhood-education-and-care-australia/approved-care-types/home-care) on the Department of Education website.
