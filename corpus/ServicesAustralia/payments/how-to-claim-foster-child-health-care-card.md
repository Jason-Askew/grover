# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim a Foster Child Health Care Card. Before you start, check if you can get it.

You can claim the card when you make a claim for [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit).

If you’re not eligible for Family Tax Benefit, you can claim the card separately.

## Steps to claim Foster Child Health Care Card

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. If you have a [correspondence nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22681) they can also claim for you online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they also need to have their own account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22681).
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=22681) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22681) and your foster child’s identity with us before you start your claim.
