# Who can get it

You need to meet both non-medical and medical rules to get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

## on this page

-   [Rules you need to meet](#a1)
-   [Guide to help you understand the rules](#a2)
-   [Other support you can get](#a3)
-   [Support while we assess your claim](#a4)

Not everyone with disability or a medical condition can get DSP.

## Rules you need to meet

To get DSP, you need to meet both:

-   non-medical rules
-   medical rules.

Non-medical rules include things like your age, residence status, and income and assets.

Medical rules help us assess how your condition affects you.

Read about the [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and [medical rules](/medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you need to meet.

## Guide to help you understand the rules

You can use our [DSP pre-claim guide](/before-claiming-disability-support-pension?context=22276) to help you decide whether to claim DSP. However, it won’t tell you if you’ll get DSP.

## Other support you can get

You can claim or still access services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) if you’re claiming or getting DSP. Find out more on the [NDIS website](https://www.ndis.gov.au/participants).

You may not be eligible for DSP if you get certain payments from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). Find out more about [getting a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) payment](/getting-department-veterans-affairs-dva-payment?context=22276).

You may be able to do a free SEE course to gain reading, writing, maths and computer skills to help you find work or study.

If you do a SEE course, you may be able to get the [Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement](/language-literacy-and-numeracy-supplement).

Find out more about the [SEE program](https://www.dewr.gov.au/skills-education-and-employment/participants) on the Department of Employment & Workplace Relations website.

## Support while we assess your claim

If you claim DSP, you may be eligible for [financial support](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276) while we assess your claim. This may be an income support payment such as:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
-   [Youth Allowance for job seekers](/youth-allowance-for-job-seekers).

If you want one of these payments you may need to claim it separately to DSP. If you claim DSP using the online claim, you can claim JobSeeker Payment as part of your online claim.

### If you already get an income support payment

If you already get an income support payment, you won’t need to meet mutual obligation requirements while we assess your DSP claim.

### If you can’t get DSP

You may still be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
