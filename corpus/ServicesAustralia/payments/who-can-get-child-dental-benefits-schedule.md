# Who can get it

Check if your child is eligible for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS).

You don’t need to apply or register for CDBS. If your child is eligible we’ll send you a letter.

Your child can get CDBS when all of the following applies:

-   they're eligible for Medicare
-   they're between 0 and 17 years old for at least one day that calendar year
-   you or they get an [eligible payment](/eligible-payments-for-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426) at least once that calendar year.

You can be either the child’s:

-   parent, carer or guardian
-   approved care organisation.

## If you’re a teenager and have a partner

You may be able to get CDBS in a calendar year when either:

-   you’re 17 years old, or younger for at least one day that calendar year
-   your partner gets an [eligible payment](/eligible-payments-for-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426) from us.
