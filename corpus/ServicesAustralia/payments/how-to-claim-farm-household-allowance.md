# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Farm Household Allowance (FHA). Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim FHA

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).
    
    You may need to [confirm your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22161) with us before you start your claim.
    
    #### If you want to claim with your partner
    
    There is an online combined partner claim option. To use this option, all the following must apply before starting your claim. You and your partner:
    
    -   have your own myGov accounts linked to your own Centrelink online accounts
    -   are subscribed to [electronic messaging](/electronic-messaging)
    -   are linked as a couple with us before starting your claim
    -   have at least one bank account recorded in joint names
    -   have your relationship status recorded with us
    -   are not already getting an income support payment or have a draft claim for FHA
    -   can provide us with accurate information regarding both of your circumstances to support your claim.
    
    If you or your partner have a [nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22161#nominee), they can’t do your combined claim online.
    
    If you are in crisis, you may be able to get a different income support payment. Contact us on the [farmer assistance hotline](#toolbar-phone).
    
    You’ll need to get all [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-farm-household-allowance-claim?context=22161) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    If you are unsure if you and your partner meet the criteria above, please contact us on the [farmer assistance hotline](#toolbar-phone).
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can claim online.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-claims/make-a-claim/life-event-details/other)
    
    Make sure you submit the claim within 13 weeks from when you started it. If you don’t, it’ll expire and you’ll need to start again.
    
    Based on your answers, we may ask if you also want to claim Farm Household Allowance for your partner. If you choose a combined claim, and your partner meets the criteria listed above, the partner claim will be available at the end of your claim. Your partner will get an SMS or email from us to let them know. We’ll advise them to
    
    -   sign in to myGov and select **Centrelink**
    -   select the task on their homepage
    -   answer questions.
    
    They’ll have 3 days to do this before the task disappears. If this happens, they’ll need to start again and submit their own individual FHA claim. You’ll need to submit the claim within 14 days to make sure payment starts on the same date for both people.
    
    You’ll need to upload all your [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-farm-household-allowance-claim?context=22161) before you submit your claim.
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    Call the [farmer assistance hotline](#toolbar-phone) and talk to us about your options to claim Farm Household Allowance (FHA).
    
    If you can’t claim online, you can print, complete and lodge the [Claim for Farm Household Allowance form](/su694).
    
    You can ask [someone to act for you](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22161). Your nominee can submit an individual FHA paper claim on your behalf.
    
    You need to complete your claim in full before you can get a payment. We need all supporting documents before we can start to process your claim. You can submit them using any of the following options:
    
    -   by [uploading them online](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online)
    -   by posting them to:
