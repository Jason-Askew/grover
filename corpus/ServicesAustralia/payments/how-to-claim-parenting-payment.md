Complete the following steps to claim Parenting Payment.

Before you start, check if you’re [eligible](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/who-can-get-parenting-payment?context=22196) for Parenting Payment.

## 1:  Parenting Payment – guide to claim

We will guide you through the claim process.

You can’t submit a claim for Parenting Payment before the birth of a child.

We generally assess your Parenting Payment from the date you submit your claim and documents.

We can backdate your payments if you submit your claim and documents within either 4 weeks of:

- your child’s birth
- the date the child came into your care.

## 2:  Do you have a Parenting Payment claim in progress?
