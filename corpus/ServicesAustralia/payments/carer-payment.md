# Carer Payment

A payment if you give constant care to someone with disability or a medical condition, or an adult who’s frail aged.

This payment can help you if you provide constant care to someone who needs care for at least 6 months. This payment is also if you’re caring for someone at the end of their life.

The amount of Carer Payment you get depends on your personal circumstances. This includes any income you or your partner get from employment.

## Claiming Carer Payment

You can claim at any time. If you’re eligible for Carer Payment we usually only pay you from the date you lodge your claim.

When you start your claim, we’ll ask you about the person you care for and the care they need. We’ll tell you if you need to give us any supporting evidence.

If we don’t already have this information, we’ll ask you to complete medical forms.
