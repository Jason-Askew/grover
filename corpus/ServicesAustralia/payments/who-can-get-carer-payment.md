# Who can get it

To get Carer Payment, both you and the person you provide care for need to be eligible.

## on this page

-   [Care needs](#a1)
-   [Department of Veterans’ Affairs payments](#a2)

To get this payment you and the person you care for need to meet some rules. You need to both:

-   be [Australian residents](/residence-rules-for-carer-payment?context=21816)
-   meet an [income and assets test](/income-and-assets-test-for-carer-payment?context=21816).

## Care needs

You may be able to get this payment if you:

-   provide constant care to someone who needs care for at least 6 months
-   are caring for someone at the end of their life.

Constant care means you provide care for a large amount of time daily. This is roughly equal to a normal working day and stops you from working full time.

The care can include:

-   physical help, such as needing to be lifted or help to get dressed
-   guidance, such as support shopping and taking the right medication
-   supervision, to support independence and safety.

You may still get Carer Payment if you do paid work or are self-employed for up to 100 hours in a 4 week period. Read more about [working while you get Carer Payment](/working-while-you-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

You can care for one or more people, in their home. If you care for more than one person, read about [caring for multiple people](/rules-for-caring-for-multiple-people-and-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

You may still get Carer Payment if you take time away from caring. Read more about [how to keep your payment](/how-to-keep-your-carer-payment?context=21816) when taking time away from caring.

When you claim, we’ll ask you about the person you care for and the care they need. Read more about the [rules for the person you care for](/rules-for-person-you-care-for-to-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

## Department of Veterans’ Affairs payments

If you get a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) payment, you may not be able to get Carer Payment. Check your eligibility if you’re [getting a Department of Veterans’ Affairs payment](/getting-department-veterans-affairs-dva-payment?context=21816).

If you’re deciding between Carer Payment and DVA’s Veteran Payment, it’s important you understand what each payment offers. Read how [Veteran Payment affects your Carer Payment](/veteran-payment-affects-your-income-support-payment?context=21816).

If you can’t get Carer Payment, there could be [other payments](/getting-payment-if-youre-carer) you may be eligible for.
