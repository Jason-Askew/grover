## Steps to claim Disability Support Pension

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    Before you start, you can use our [DSP pre-claim guide](/before-claiming-disability-support-pension?context=22276) to help you decide whether to claim.
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. If you have a correspondence [nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22276) they can also claim for you online.
    
    An advocate can support you while you’re seeking help, claiming a payment from us, and can also attend appointments with you. Read about [getting help with your DSP claim](/getting-help-with-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they also need to have their own online account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22276).
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22691) with us before you start your claim.
    
    If you’re about to turn 16, you can start your claim early. You can do this from 13 weeks before you turn 16.
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You’ll need [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) for the claim.
    
    You need to give us all the medical evidence and supporting documents we ask for. If you don’t, we may not accept your claim or we may reject it.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can apply online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to myGov.
    2.  Select **Go to Centrelink**.
    3.  Select **Make a claim or view claim status**, then **Make a claim**.
    4.  Under **Disabled, ill or injured**, select **Get started** then follow the prompts to complete your claim.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    If you can’t claim online you can [claim by form](/claiming-disability-support-pension-form?context=22276).
    
4.  ### 4\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you all of the following:
    
    -   you’ve submitted your claim
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   the date we estimate your claim will be complete
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your claim online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status**.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    We’ll contact you if either:
    
    -   we need more details
    -   you need to attend an assessment.
    
    #### Support while we assess your claim
    
    If you claim DSP, you may be eligible for financial support while we assess your claim. This may be an income support payment such as:
    
    -   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
    -   [Youth Allowance for job seekers](/youth-allowance-for-job-seekers).
    
    If you want one of these income support payments, you may need to claim it separately to DSP. If you claim DSP using the online claim, you can claim JobSeeker Payment as part of your online claim.
    
    ##### If you’re granted or already get another income support payment
    
    You won’t need to meet mutual obligation requirements while we assess your DSP claim.
    
    However, you can choose to keep meeting your requirements as it can help your participation in a Program of Support.
    
    Read about how [Program of Support](/program-support-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) helps people with disability to prepare for, find and keep a job.
    
5.  ### 5\. Claim outcome
    
    We’ll send you a letter to let you know your claim outcome.
    
    If your claim is unsuccessful, we’ll let you know.
    
    If you don’t agree with our decision, call us on the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone). We’ll explain it and make sure it’s correct.
    
    If you still don’t agree, you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews?context=64107).
    
    If you’re eligible for DSP, we’ll let you know:
    
    -   when you’ll get your first payment
    -   how much you’ll get.
