-   [Austudy](/austudy)
-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)

You can also get a card for up to one year if you get any of the following payments:

-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment) for short term or irregular care less than 6 months
-   the maximum rate of [Family Tax Benefit Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#maxrate)
-   [Mobility Allowance](/mobility-allowance) if you’re not getting [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension).

You must also live in Australia and meet the residence rules of that payment.

If you get [Carer Payment](/carer-payment), your card is valid for a period of 26 weeks. But only if you get it for episodic or short term care for a child.

You may get a different [concession or health care card](/concession-and-health-care-cards) if you can’t get a Health Care Card.

We’ll send you one if you’re getting or are eligible for any of the following payments:

-   [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance)
-   [Austudy](/austudy)
-   [Youth Allowance for students](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices) and [apprentices](/top-payments-for-apprenticeship).

This means you’ll get both your payment and Health Care Card at the time you get approval.

## Shared care

A child in your care will be on your Health Care Card if you share their care with someone else. You must care for them for a certain amount of time. The percentage of shared care needed depends on the payment you get.
