# How to report and manage your payment

To keep getting JobSeeker Payment you need to report every 2 weeks. You also need to keep meeting your mutual obligation requirements.

To keep getting your payment you’ll need to:

- report, including you and your partner’s employment income every 2 weeks even if it’s $0 or report $0 if you’re not working
- meet your [mutual obligation requirements](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=51411)
- tell us about any [changes to your circumstances](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/change-circumstances-when-you-get-jobseeker-payment?context=51411)
- [tell us if you’re going overseas](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-jobseeker-payment?context=51411).

If you’re having trouble meeting your mutual obligation requirements, you need to talk to someone about it. Who you need to contact depends on if you are either:

- with an employment services provider
- with Workforce Australia Online.

## Getting help if you have an employment services provider

If you have an employment services provider, you should speak with them first. Otherwise, call the [National Customer Service Line](https://www.workforceaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us/) on the Workforce Australia website.

## Getting help if you’re with Workforce Australia Online

If you’re referred to Workforce Australia Online, call the [Digital Services Contact Centre](https://www.workforceaustralia.gov.au/individuals/contact-us/) on the Workforce Australia website.

## Completing your report

If your claim is approved, you’ll need to report to get your first payment. You’ll still need to report every 2 weeks even if you and your partner aren’t working.

### If you’re working for an employer

When you report, you’ll need to let us know if you and your partner have been paid employment income. If you’ve reported before, some of your [employment details may be pre-filled](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/when-we-pre-fill-your-information?context=51411).

You still need to report even if you and your partner haven’t worked in the reporting period or been paid any income. If you’ve worked but haven’t been paid, you can report the hours you have worked. To keep your payment, you need to report every 2 weeks and include any employment income you and your partner got paid in the reporting period.

If you don’t report every 2 weeks, your payment will stop. We’ll tell you which dates you must report on and when your reporting will start. If you report late, your payment will be late.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to report your income.

You can also report your income by:

- using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
- calling 133 276 (13 EARN).

You’ll need to call us on [Centrelink employment services line](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/phone-us#jobseekers) if any of these apply:

- you can’t update your employment income online
- you’re not sure how to report your back pay.

### If you’re self-employed

You must report self-employment income to us, but you shouldn’t include it in your employment income report. You might know this as business income.
