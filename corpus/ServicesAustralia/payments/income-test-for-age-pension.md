Your income can reduce how much Age Pension we pay you. We use the pension income test to assess Age Pension.

## What the income test is

We assess both your and your partner’s income from all sources. This includes financial assets such as savings, shares and superannuation. To work out how much income your financial assets produce, we use [deeming](/deeming?context=22526).

If you or your partner work, you’ll need to report any employment income you’ve been paid. Read about [employment income reporting](/employment-income-reporting?context=22526).

You don’t need to give us your payslips unless we ask you for them.

Read about [working while you’re getting Age Pension](/working-while-youre-getting-age-pension?context=22526).

Age Pension has income and asset free areas and limits. If you’re over the free area, you get a lower pension until you reach the limit or cut off point.

If you’re permanently blind and get Age Pension, we don’t use the income test unless you get [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) or your partner is getting a payment and is not also blind.

## What the standard rules are

These are the income rules for most pensioners. Read about the [Work Bonus](/work-bonus) and how it can help you keep more of your pension when you’re working.
