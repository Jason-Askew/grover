# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim a Low Income Health Care Card. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim a Low Income Health Care Card

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. If you have a correspondence [nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=21986) they can also claim for you online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they also need to have their own myGov account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account, you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=21986).
    
    You’ll need to get your [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=21986) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22691) with us before you start your claim.
    
    If you have a partner who’s also eligible for a card, they’ll need to submit their own online claim.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can apply online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to myGov.
    2.  Select **Make a claim or view claim status**, then **Make a claim**.
    3.  Select **Concession Cards** and follow the prompts to complete your claim.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can’t claim online
    
    If you can’t claim a Low Income Health Care Card online, you can either:
    
    -   call us on the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone)
    -   go to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).
    
3.  ### 3\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you:
    
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   the date we estimate your claim will be complete
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your claim online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status**.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    You can also do this on the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).
    
    We’ll send a message to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online) to let you know the result of your application. If you don’t get electronic letters, we’ll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details we’ll ask you for them.
    
    If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews-centrelink-decision).

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).
