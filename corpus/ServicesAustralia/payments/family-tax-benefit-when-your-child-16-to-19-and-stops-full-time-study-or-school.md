# Your child is 16 to 19 and stops full time study or school

If your child turns 16 and stops studying full time or going to school after they turn 16, your Family Tax Benefit (FTB) may change.

## When your child is 16 to 19

If you and your child continue to meet FTB requirements, we’ll still pay FTB after they turn 16.

You can keep getting FTB for your child if they’re 16 to 19 and they are either:

-   in full time secondary study
-   have an acceptable adjusted study load
-   exempt from study requirements.

Your child must also not get either of the following:

-   an [income support payment](/income-support-payment) in their own right
-   a payment from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA).

Payments from DVA include:

-   Veterans’ Children Education Scheme
-   Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme payment.

You usually can’t get FTB for a child over 16 who gets a means tested ABSTUDY payment. We can only pay both if your child gets [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance) or [School Fees Allowance higher rate](/abstudy-school-fees-allowance-higher-rate), and they are all of the following:

-   in full time secondary study
-   approved to live away from home to study
-   boarding to attend school.

We may pay FTB Part A until the end of the calendar year in which your child turns 19. This is if your child’s in [full time secondary study](#fulltimestudy) or is [exempt from the study requirements](#exemptions).

We may pay FTB Part B until the end of the calendar year in which your child turns 18. This is if both of the following apply:

-   you’re a single parent or non parent carer, or a [grandparent carer](/support-for-grandparent-carers?context=22151)
-   your child is in [full time secondary study](#fulltimestudy) or is [exempt from the study requirements](#exemptions).

If you can’t get FTB, find out more about [payments your child can get if your FTB stops](#otherpmtsyourchild).

## If your child stops studying or going to school before completing year 12

To get FTB for your child after they turn 16, they must be either:

-   studying fulltime and working towards completing year 12
-   participating in an equivalent qualification.

If your child is 16 or older and stops studying, you need to update their study end date to stop FTB being paid for them.

You need to notify us of this change, or you could get overpaid.

Find out more about [leaving school](/leaving-secondary-school).

## When your child completes year 12 or equivalent qualification

When your child completes year 12 or an equivalent qualification, your FTB for that child will stop. When it stops depends on when they completed their study.

If they complete year 12 or an equivalent qualification:

-   before November, your FTB will stop 28 days after your child completes their studies
-   in November or December, your FTB will stop on 31 December.

You may not need to update your child’s study end date to reflect the actual date they complete their studies. This is if both of the following apply:

-   we have their study end date recorded as November or December
-   they complete year 12 or equivalent qualification on or after 1 November.

If these don’t apply, you need to update their study end date. It should reflect the actual date they complete their studies.

## What full time secondary study for FTB is

Full time secondary study can include any of the following:

-   study leading towards a year 12 qualification
-   an accredited secondary course through a secondary school, TAFE, higher education institution or special school
-   an Australian Qualification Framework Certificate II or higher qualification issued by a Registered Training Organisation or higher education institution
-   Certificate II, III or IV of General Education, the International Baccalaureate or other higher education pre-entry course.

### Study exemptions may apply

If your child can’t study full time, they may be exempt from the study requirements. This may mean you can continue to get FTB.

The exemption can be permanent or temporary. Temporary exemptions can be for up to 12 months. We review these before the exemption period ends.

To check if your child is exempt, call the [Families line](#toolbar-phone).

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income. We may have sent your child a letter asking for this in September or October, read how you can [update your income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
