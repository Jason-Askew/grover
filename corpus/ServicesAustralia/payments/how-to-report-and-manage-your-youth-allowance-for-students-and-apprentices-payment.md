# How to report and manage your payment

There are things you need to do while you’re getting Youth Allowance as a student or an Australian Apprentice.

You’ll need to:

-   [report any income](/employment-income-reporting?context=43916) you earn
-   report if your [study load](/study-loads-for-austudy-and-youth-allowance?context=43916) changes
-   tell us about any [changes to your circumstances](/change-circumstances-while-getting-youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916)
-   tell us if you’re [going overseas](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-apprentices-if-you-travel-outside-australia?context=43916).

Call us on the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone) to tell us if any of the following happen:

-   you don’t remain enrolled in your course
-   you don’t plan on returning to study
-   your study load reduces
-   you’re getting the away from home rate of payment from us and you’re no longer maintaining your term address.

## If you don’t do these things

We may pay you the wrong amount and you’ll get a debt you’ll need to repay.

To find more information about your payments, go to **My payments** in your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account). There, you’ll be able to see information including how we work out your payment and how much we’ll pay you.

### Getting help managing regular deductions from your payment

You can arrange regular deductions from your Centrelink payments to pay bills. Read more about [Centrepay](/centrepay).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.
