# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Double Orphan Pension. Before you start, check if you can get it.

## Steps to claim Double Orphan Pension

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    If you haven’t claimed Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the child, you must submit a claim for FTB first.
    
    To claim you can either:
    
    -   print and complete the [Double Orphan Pension claim form](/sc003)
    -   call the [Child bereavement and Double Orphan Pension helpdesk](#toolbar-phone)
    -   go to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    You’ll need to get some information ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
    You may need to give us:
    
    -   the child’s birth certificate
    -   confirmation of the child’s refugee status
    -   confirmation that the child’s parent or parents have died.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim
    
    You can’t claim online but you can submit your completed claim form and supporting documents we ask for online. You can also submit them by post or in person.
