# How to claim

Complete the following steps to apply for Child Care Subsidy (CCS). Before you start, check if you can get it.

## 1: Guide to claiming CCS

We’ll guide you through the claim process for new claims. We’ll also help you update an existing claim to add another child.

A CCS claim can be backdated to the first Monday of a CCS fortnight, no more than 28 days before your claim was submitted.

A CCS fortnight is two weeks long. For example, the first CCS fortnight for the 2025-26 financial year started on Monday 7 July 2025, and then every second Monday after that.

Your child must attend child care at least once in the first 26 weeks, following the start of your CCS. [If your child is absent from child care](/child-care-subsidy-if-your-child-absent-from-child-care), your payment may stop. You’ll also need to submit a new claim if you want to get CCS again.

Before you start, check if you’re [eligible](/who-can-get-child-care-subsidy) for CCS.

## 2: Do you already get Child Care Subsidy and want to add another child?

[Yes: Go to 3](#dc-53804-s-2) [No: Go to 4](#dc-53804-s-3)

## 3: How to add another child to an existing Child Care Subsidy claim

You can add a child to your CCS by using the ‘Add child’ service in your online account.

To add a child online the following must apply:

-   you get CCS for at least one other child
-   you get Family Tax Benefit for the child you want added.

You can’t use this service if any of the following apply:

-   you already get CCS for the child you want to add
-   you have a current claim with us for the child you want to add
-   you get Additional Child Care Subsidy.

Steps to add a child to your CCS using your online account:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **My family**.
3.  Under **Child care**, select **Child Care Subsidy summary**.
4.  Select **Add child to Child Care Subsidy** then follow the prompts to complete your claim.

If this option isn’t available, you’ll need to start a new claim.

If you’ve completed your claim but your child’s enrolment details haven’t been confirmed, you must take action. Ask your provider to submit your child’s enrolment. You’ll then need to check the details and [confirm them](/confirm-enrolment-for-child-care-subsidy). You can do this through your Centrelink online account.

If you don’t agree with the decision we’ve made about your claim call the [Families line](/phone-us#families). If you still don’t agree, you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews-centrelink-decision).
