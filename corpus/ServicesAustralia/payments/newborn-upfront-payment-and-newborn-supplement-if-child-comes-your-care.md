# A child comes into your care

If a child comes into your care, for example, through foster care, you may be eligible for Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement.

This applies if:

-   the child is younger than 1
-   you're eligible for [FTB Part A](/family-tax-benefit-part-eligibility)
-   the child stays in your care for at least 13 continuous weeks from the date you first became eligible for Newborn Supplement.
