# How to claim

Complete the following steps to claim Crisis Payment for humanitarian entrants. Before you start, check if you can get it.

If you need to establish your identity or create a Centrelink online account, you can do this using [myGov](https://my.gov.au/).

## Steps to claim a Crisis Payment for Humanitarian Entrants

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online. If you have a correspondence nominee they can also claim for you online. If you’re not getting an income support payment, you’ll need to claim one before you can claim a Crisis Payment.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they also need to have their own account. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=52756).
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    #### If you can claim online
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can claim online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to myGov and go to **Centrelink**.
    2.  Select **Payments and Claims** from the menu, then **Claims**, then **Make a claim**.
    3.  Select **Crisis Payment**.
    4.  Select **Apply for Crisis Payment for Humanitarian Entrants**.
    5.  Answer all the questions.
    6.  Submit your claim.
    
    [Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)
    
    #### If you can't claim online
    
    If you can’t claim online, you can call your [regular payment line](/phone-us).
    
    #### Supporting documents
    
    We may ask you to give us more documents to support your claim. If you can’t give them to us straight away, you can still submit the claim. You then have 14 days to give us the documents.
    
3.  ### 3\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you:
    
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   the date we estimate your claim will be complete
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    You can track the progress of your claim online. Sign in to myGov and go to Centrelink, or use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.
    
    We’ll let you know the result of your claim. If you choose to get Centrelink letters online, we’ll send a letter to your myGov Inbox. If you don’t get letters online, we’ll send you a letter in the mail.
    
    If we need more details we’ll ask you for them.
