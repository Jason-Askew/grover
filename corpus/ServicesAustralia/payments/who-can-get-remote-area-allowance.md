# Who can get it

There are 2 ways to get Remote Area Allowance.

## on this page

-   [Option 1](#a1)
-   [Option 2](#a2)
-   [Remote area](#a3)
-   [Can’t get it](#a4)
-   [Students](#a5)
-   [Claim](#a6)

## Option 1

You can get it if you live in a remote area and get either:

-   an [income support payment](/income-support-payment)
-   [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance).

## Option 2

You can get it if you moved to a remote area, and will stay longer than 12 months.

## Remote area

Tax zones define remote areas. The Tax Office determines tax zones. The [Australian tax offset zone list](https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/tax-offsets-australian-zones) on the Australian Taxation website will tell you if you live in a remote area. These include:

-   tax zone A
-   special zone A
-   special zone B.

## Can’t get it

You can't get it if you either:

-   move outside the tax zones above
-   live in tax zone B
-   live in a certain region within special zone A.

## Students

You can get this allowance for 8 weeks from the date you leave your usual home if you:

-   are a student
-   get [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance), [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance) or [Austudy](/austudy)
-   live in a remote area, except during your study.

The 8 week limit doesn’t apply to secondary school students getting [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance).

## Claim

You don’t need to claim this allowance.

We’ll check if you can get it when you either:

-   get your income support payment
-   move to an eligible tax zone.

If you can get it, we’ll tell you when your payment starts and how much you get.
