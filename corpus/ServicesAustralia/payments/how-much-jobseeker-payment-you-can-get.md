JobSeeker Payment is a taxable Centrelink payment. You can ask us to [deduct tax from your payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/deduct-tax-from-your-payment?context=51411). This can help reduce the amount of tax you may have to pay at the end of the tax year.

JobSeeker Payment may affect the amount of [child support](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/managing-child-support) you pay or receive. You need to tell us [if your income changes](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21911).
