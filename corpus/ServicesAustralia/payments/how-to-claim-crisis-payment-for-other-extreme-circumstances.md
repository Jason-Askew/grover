## Steps to claim a Crisis Payment for Other Extreme Circumstances

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.
    
    To do this, you’ll need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you have a nominee they can claim online for you, but they’ll need to have their own account.
    
    If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=52754).
    
    You can also prepare supporting documents before you claim.
    
2.  ### 2\. Make your claim
    
    If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov you can claim online.
    
    To do this:
    
    1.  Sign in to **myGov** and go to **Centrelink**.
    2.  Select **Payments and Claims** from the menu, then **Claims**, then **Make a claim**.
    3.  Select **Crisis Payments**.
    4.  Select **Apply for Crisis Payment for Other Extreme Circumstances**.
    5.  Answer all the questions.
    6.  Upload evidence verifying the [extreme circumstance](/who-can-get-crisis-payment-for-other-extreme-circumstances?context=52754) such as a police or fire report.
    7.  Submit your claim.
    
    If you have moved house, you will need to [update your address](/changing-your-address-if-youre-moving-house?context=60023) within 14 days.

    #### If you can't claim online
    
    If you can’t claim online, you can either:
    
    -   [call](/phone-us) your regular payment line
    -   visit us.
    
3.  ### 3\. Track your claim
    
    After you submit your claim online, you’ll get a receipt telling you:
    
    -   the ID number of your claim
    -   the date we estimate your claim will be complete
    -   a link to track its progress.
    
    To track the progress of your application online, sign in to myGov and select **Make a claim or view claim status**.
