You need to meet eligibility for the Continence Aids Payment Scheme (CAPS).

To get paid under CAPS you must meet all of the following:

-   be 5 years or older
-   have permanent and severe incontinence confirmed by a registered health professional
-   be an Australian citizen, permanent resident or have permanent residency rights for as long as you get the payment
-   have eligible [neurological conditions](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/caps-eligible-neurological-conditions) or [other conditions](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/caps-eligible-other-conditions) as mentioned on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.
