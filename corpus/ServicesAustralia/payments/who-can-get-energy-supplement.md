# Who can get it

To get Energy Supplement you must get a certain payment or card from us.

You can get it if you [live in Australia](/residence-descriptions?context=22286) and get either:

-   an [income support payment](/income-support-payment)
-   [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance).

You might get it, if you became eligible for either of these on or before 19 September 2016:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit)
-   [Commonwealth Seniors Health Card](/commonwealth-seniors-health-card).

## If you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

### Eligible for FTB on or before 19 September 2016

If you were eligible on or before 19 September 2016, we’ll pay Energy Supplement with your regular FTB payment. We’ll keep paying Energy Supplement unless there is a break in your eligibility for FTB.

### Eligible for FTB after the 19 September 2016

If you were eligible for FTB after 19 September 2016, you might get Energy Supplement. If you’re eligible, we’ll pay Energy Supplement with either your:

-   [income support payment](/income-support-payment)
-   [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance).

If you don’t get an income support payment or ABSTUDY Living Allowance with your FTB, you won’t get Energy Supplement.

If you stop being eligible for the payment you get, your Energy Supplement will also stop.

### Example when eligible for FTB on or before 19 September 2016

Mirri became eligible for FTB on 15 June 2016, making them also eligible for Energy Supplement.

In July 2018 we cancelled Mirri’s FTB, later that year they claimed FTB again and payments started. Mirri did not get Energy Supplement again because there was a break in FTB eligibility.

## If you get a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC)

### Eligible CSHC holder on or before 19 September 2016

If we granted you a Commonwealth Senior Heath Card on or before 19 September 2016, we’ll pay you an Energy Supplement. We’ll keep paying Energy Supplement unless there is a break in your eligibility for a CSHC.

### Eligible CSHC holder after the 19 September 2016

If we granted you a Commonwealth Senior Heath Card after 19 September 2016, you will not get Energy Supplement.

### Move from an income support payment to a CSHC

When your income support payment stops, we may keep paying you Energy Supplement. But both of these must apply:

-   you were on an income support payment on or before 19 September 2016
-   you claim a CSHC and are eligible for it within 6 weeks of your payment stopping.

If you do this, you’ll keep getting Energy Supplement as long as you stay eligible for a CSHC.

### Example when moving from an income support payment to a CSHC

Kaiya became eligible for Age Pension on 1 August 2016, which meant they were also eligible for Energy Supplement.

On 1 April 2021, Kaiya stopped being eligible for Age Pension but was eligible to claim a CSHC. Kaiya put in a claim and was eligible for a CSHC within 6 weeks of Age Pension stopping.

Because Kaiya claimed a CSHC within 6 weeks of Age Pension stopping, they will continue to get Energy Supplement.

If Kaiya missed the 6-week deadline, they would not get Energy Supplement.
