# Sickness Allowance

You can no longer claim Sickness Allowance. But you may be able to claim another income support payment.

If you’re sick or injured and can’t do your usual work or study, you can apply for [JobSeeker Payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/jobseeker-payment).

We also have [translated information about JobSeeker Payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/job-seekers-translation).
