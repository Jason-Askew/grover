# ABSTUDY Fares Allowance for boarding schools and hostels

You have an important role in arranging travel to and from home for your ABSTUDY students.

ABSTUDY high school students living away from home and [other approved travellers](/who-can-education-providers-claim-abstudy-fares-allowance-for?context=23251) can get ABSTUDY Fares Allowance. This ABSTUDY support helps with the costs of different [types of trips](/when-education-providers-can-claim-abstudy-fares-allowance-for-student-travel?context=23251) between home and school during the term.

Boarding schools and hostels can either:

-   ask us to [pre-book travel before the trip](/how-education-providers-can-book-travel-with-abstudy?context=23251)
-   [claim a reimbursement](/how-to-claim-abstudy-travel-reimbursement-education-provider?context=23251) after the trip.

We have a guide to pre-book ABSTUDY travel with us or claim a reimbursement after travel:

## Your responsibilities

When you request ABSTUDY travel, you’ll need to do the following:

-   submit travel requests within the required time frame
-   let families know when their child will be travelling
-   tell us if students need extra baggage requirements
-   ensure students, parents or guardians, and supervisors know about [their responsibilities](/your-responsibilities-when-you-get-abstudy-fares-allowance) as ABSTUDY travellers.

To help each student safely complete their trip, you might also need to:

-   arrange a [travel supervisor](/who-can-education-providers-claim-abstudy-fares-allowance-for?context=23251), if they need one
-   have a [Safe Travel Plan](/how-education-providers-can-make-safe-travel-plan-for-abstudy-travel?context=23251).
