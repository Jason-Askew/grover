# Rules for the person you care for

To get this payment, both you and the person you care for need to meet some rules.

To get Carer Allowance the person you care for:

-   needs care for at least 12 months, or has a terminal medical condition
-   is assessed as needing care by a medical professional
-   can be cared for in their home or your home
-   meet the [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-carer-allowance?context=21811).

You may get Carer Allowance for more than one person. You can get Carer Allowance for up to 2 adults and more than one child.

The questions we ask you during the claim help us to determine if you're eligible.

As part of your claim we’ll ask you how you care for them. The treating doctor of the person you care for will need to complete a medical form. In some cases we may be able to use existing medical information we have. Start your claim and we’ll tell you if we need an updated medical form.

## When you can get a Health Care Card

If you’re caring for a person over the age of 16, they can’t get a [Health Care Card](/health-care-card) as well as Carer Allowance.

If you care for a child younger than 16, you can get a Health Care Card as well as Carer Allowance.

If you’re caring for a child with lower care needs you may not be able to get Carer Allowance. But you may still be able to get a Health Care Card for them.
