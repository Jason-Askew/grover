# Non-student travellers

Sometimes, someone other than you can get ABSTUDY Fares Allowance.

To get it they need to be either:

-   your dependant, like a partner or dependent child
-   a family or community member
-   your supervisor
-   a travelling companion
-   an educational institution representative.

These travellers can also get financial help for [overnight accommodation](/abstudy-fares-allowance-for-overnight-accommodation-costs?context=22701) and meals, but not for any loss of pay.
