# Newstart Allowance

Newstart Allowance stopped on 20 March 2020. JobSeeker Payment is the main income support payment if you’re between 22 and Age Pension age.

To get JobSeeker Payment you must meet some rules. You must also be either:

- looking for work
- unable to do your usual work or study while you recover from a sickness or injury.

On 20 March 2020, if you were already getting Newstart Allowance, you moved to JobSeeker Payment. Unless your situation has changed, your [mutual obligation requirements](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/mutual-obligation-requirements) haven’t changed. You need to meet them to keep getting JobSeeker Payment.
