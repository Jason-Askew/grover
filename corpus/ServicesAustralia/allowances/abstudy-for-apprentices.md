## What help you can get

ABSTUDY is a group of payments and support. Watch this video to learn how ABSTUDY can help when you’re an apprentice or trainee.

[Transcript](/sites/default/files/2022-10/transcript-abstudy-for-higher-education-and-training.docx "Word document") | [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkOESQiHegs)

To get support, you’ll need to be a full time [Australian Apprentice, trainee or trainee apprentice](https://www.apprenticeships.gov.au/).

The main payment is [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance). We pay this each fortnight to help with living costs while you’re training. If you get it, you’ll also get ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance.

[ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance](/abstudy-incidentals-allowance) is paid at the start of each year of your apprenticeship or traineeship.

If you get Living Allowance and need extra help, you can apply for [Additional Assistance](/abstudy-living-allowance-additional-assistance). This is a one off payment to help you stay in your apprenticeship, if you’re in severe financial stress.

## How to get started

Before you claim, read about the eligibility for each payment.

You can [claim Living Allowance online](/claiming-abstudy-living-allowance-tertiary-student-or-australian-apprentice). You should do this before your apprenticeship starts. If you claim after starting your apprenticeship, we may only pay from the date you submitted your claim.

If you claim Living Allowance, you don’t need to claim Incidentals Allowance. We’ll pay it automatically.

If your income is too high for Living Allowance, you can [claim Incidentals Allowance](/claiming-abstudy-incidentals-allowance-higher-education-student-or-australian-apprentice) on its own. You can claim up to 13 weeks before the start of your apprenticeship.

If you need help or can’t claim online because of a medical condition or special circumstances, call the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).
