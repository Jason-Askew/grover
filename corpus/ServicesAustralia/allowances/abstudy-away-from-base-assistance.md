# ABSTUDY Away from Base Assistance

Help for Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to attend study activities. Students must be away from their home or study location for a short period.

The activity must be a necessary part of your approved course. We call these activities away from base activities.

## What it covers

You may get Away from Base Assistance for any of the following activities:

-   residential schools, including students studying via distance education to attend face to face lectures and tutorials on campus
-   a placement part of a tertiary course, where you need to do practical training in a work environment
-   field trips that provide practical activities or experiences and are part of your tertiary course.  

You may also get it for testing or assessments to gain entry to either:

-   a tertiary course
-   an enabling course at university.

It helps with your costs while you’re participating in an approved activity. This includes reasonable costs of accommodation and meals while away from your normal place of residence. You may also get 1 return trip to and from the activity under [ABSTUDY Fares Allowance](/abstudy-fares-allowance). This doesn’t include day to day travel while you’re at the activity.
