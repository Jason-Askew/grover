## What the Carer Allowance income review is

The income review is a way we collect your and your partner’s income details. It’s only for customers who get Carer Allowance or a Carer Allowance Health Care Card.

## Why you may need to do the review

There’s an income test for Carer Allowance and Carer Allowance Health Care Card. To get either of these, your and your partner’s adjusted taxable income must be under $250,000 a financial year.

Reviewing your income helps us check we’re paying you correctly.

## Who has to do the review

We’ll send you a letter if we need your up to date income details. This applies to both Centrelink and Department of Veterans’ Affairs customers.

If you get letters online, check your myGov Inbox or Express Plus Centrelink mobile app. If you don’t get your letters online, we’ll post the letter to you.

If we’ve asked you to do the review but you don’t think you need to, call our [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone). If you don’t do anything, your payment will stop.

### Centrelink customers

We may ask you to do the review if you don’t:

-   get a Centrelink income support payment
-   get Family Tax Benefit paid fortnightly
-   have a current Commonwealth Seniors Health Care Card.

### Department of Veterans’ Affairs customers

We’ll ask you to complete an income review if we don’t have enough up to date information about your income. We’ll do this even if you get an income tested Department of Veterans’ Affairs payment.

## When you need to do the review

We may ask you to do the review at any time. Usually, after a change to your circumstances that may affect your income.

## How to do the review

There are options for doing the review.
