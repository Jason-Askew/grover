## Who this is for

This support is for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who are both:

-   a student in school, higher education or an Australian Apprenticeship
-   in lawful custody for more than 2 weeks.

Lawful custody means a correctional institution, like a remand centre or youth training centre.

## Who we pay

We normally make the payments to your correctional institution. If they support paying the allowance to you instead, we can pay it to you.

## What help is available

To help with study and training costs while in custody, you may get [ABSTUDY Lawful Custody Allowance](/abstudy-lawful-custody-allowance). This includes textbooks, photocopying and daily travel. It doesn’t include course fees. How much we pay depends on the claimed costs.

To help attend study and training activities while in custody, you may get [ABSTUDY Away from Base Assistance](/abstudy-away-from-base-assistance). You must have permission to study away from your correctional institution for a short period to get this. You not eligible if you’re an Australian Apprentice.
