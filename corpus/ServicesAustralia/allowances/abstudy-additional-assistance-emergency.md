-   [How to claim](#a2)

## Who can get it

To get this extra help both the following must apply:

-   you’re eligible for the [higher rates of ABSTUDY when living away from home](/higher-rates-abstudy-living-allowance-when-living-away-from-home) or [ABSTUDY Away from Base Assistance](/abstudy-away-from-base-assistance)
-   an emergency or disaster has impacted you taking part in study or training.

Emergencies and disasters are serious and potentially dangerous conditions or events that need immediate action. They include any of the following:

-   federal, state or local government declared emergencies
-   natural disasters
-   major accidents
-   pandemic lockdowns
-   fires
-   cyclones
-   floods.

An emergency or disaster situation does not include personal circumstances, such as when someone close to you dies. There are payments, support and other services to [help with the death of a loved one](/death-loved-one).

## How to claim

To claim, call us on the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone). You’ll need to give us all of the following:

-   details of your impacted study or training
-   information about the emergency or disaster that impacted your study or training
-   evidence from your boarding school, welfare agency or another body that supports your claim
-   an estimate of how much you’ll need.

Your parent, guardian, education provider or residential facility can also claim this payment on your behalf.

We’ll decide how much you may get based on your situation and send you a letter.

Contact numbers available on this page.
