# Residential costs option

An option for students to help pay residential costs while living away from home to study.

The ABSTUDY residential costs option can help you manage the costs of living away from home to study.

If you're [eligible](/who-can-access-abstudy-residential-costs-option-for-living-allowance?context=45541) and choose this option, we’ll pay your educational institution or hostel directly for certain costs.

Costs can cover any of these:

-   accommodation
-   meals, if provided
-   laundry charges
-   other compulsory fees.

Costs don't cover rental bonds or other types of refundable fees.

While we’re paying your residential costs, we’ll reduce your ABSTUDY Living Allowance or not pay your ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement.

When there are no residential costs, like during study breaks, you’ll get your payment as you normally would.
