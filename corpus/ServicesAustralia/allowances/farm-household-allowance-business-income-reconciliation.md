# Business income reconciliation

The income reconciliation process ended on 30 June 2024.

The business income reconciliation compared your estimated and actual business income to check we paid you the right amount of Farm Household Allowance (FHA).

If you got FHA between 1 July 2014 and 31 June 2020 we would have reconciled your business income. We now use your business income tax return and other evidence to determine your eligibility for FHA.

If your farm business has experienced a change of circumstances, we may be able to use a [farm business income estimate](/estimating-business-income-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161) to assess your eligibility for FHA.
