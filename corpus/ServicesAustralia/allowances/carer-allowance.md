# Carer Allowance

A supplementary payment if you care for someone who needs daily support.

This fortnightly payment is for you if you give support and care to someone either:

- with disability
- with a medical condition
- who’s frail aged.

This payment is for you if the person you care for needs ongoing daily care for at least 12 months or has a terminal medical condition.

To get this payment you and the person you care for will need to meet some rules. Find out more about [if you can get it](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/who-can-get-carer-allowance?context=21811).

You may be able to get both Carer Allowance and Carer Payment depending on your circumstances. You can submit a combined claim for both payments. Learn more about [Carer Payment](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/carer-payment).
