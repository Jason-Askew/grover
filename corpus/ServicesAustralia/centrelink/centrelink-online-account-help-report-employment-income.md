For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

Employment income affects your payment from us. To make sure we’re paying you the right amount, we need you to report your and your partner’s gross employment income.

If you get Carer Payment, [follow our online guide](/centrelink-online-account-help-report-employment-income-carers) to report your paid employment income using your Centrelink online account. You can also [follow our online guide](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app-help-report-employment-income) to report your paid employment income using the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

Gross income is the amount your employer pays you before tax and other deductions. You must report the gross income your employer paid you, and gross income your partner’s employer paid them, in your reporting period. You can find your gross pay amount on your payslip.

If you’re on:

-   [scheduled reporting](/scheduled-reporting), you need to submit your report on or after your reporting date so we can check your regular payment is correct
-   [unscheduled reporting](/unscheduled-reporting), you need to tell us about any income you’re paid within 14 days of being paid by your employer.

To make sure you get paid on time, you must submit your report by 5 pm local time on your reporting date. Read more about [employment income reporting](/employment-income-reporting).

There may be other tasks or activities you need to do to keep getting your payment. This depends on the payment you get. Read more about [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements).

You may have to report in a different way based on your personal circumstances. Some steps in this guide may not apply to you.

Some employers use Single Touch Payroll (STP). This means they send your information to us and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) automatically. We use it to pre-fill information in your employment income report. You can review the information before you continue and then complete your report. You may need to change or add details so your report is complete and correct. The information we have depends on how your employer does their payroll reporting. After you review and submit the information, it’ll pre-fill into your employment income report. If you have a partner, we won’t pre-fill their information for you to review.

## Step 1: get started

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Centrelink**.

There are 2 ways to start, using either:

-   your [Tasks](#tasks)
-   the [MENU](#menu).

### Using Tasks

From the **Report income** task, select **Start task**.

### Using MENU

Select **MENU**, followed by **Income and assets**, then **Employment income** and **Report employment income**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-07/update-og-coa-report-employment-income-step1b-010724.png)

## Step 2: confirming pre-filled employment details from your employer

A **Before you report** message will tell you there’s pre-filled employment information to check, if employment details are available from your employer.

If we don’t show pre-filled information, go to [Step 3](/centrelink-online-account-help-report-employment-income#step3).

When your employer gives us your details for the first time, we’ll show your employer’s name and Australian Business Number (ABN) or Withholding Payer Number (WPN). You must confirm if you work for them. We won’t pre-fill your employment income until your next report.

Employers may have a different trading name to their registered business name. If you don’t recognise the employer name, we’ll show different business or trading names of the employer.

If you have more than one Single Touch Payroll employer, you’ll need to confirm the pre-filled information for each employer, one at a time. We won’t pre-fill your partner’s employer details. If you need help, read the information with the **question mark** icon on each page.

On your next reporting date, we’ll tell you we’ve pre-filled some pay details and what you may need to do. Select **Check employment details**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-07/update-og-coa-report-employment-income-step2a-010724.png)

We’ll show your employer’s name and Australian Business Number (ABN) and ask if you work for them.

Select either:

-   **Yes** if you work for the employer shown
-   **No** if you don’t work for the employer shown

Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step1h.png)

If you’ve already told us about your employer, select them from the list. We can then match the employer on your record.

If they’re not in the list, select **None of the above** and enter the name you want us to record your employer as. Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-02/update-og-coa-report-employment-income-step2c-100223.png)

We’ll show the following pay details:

-   Pay date
-   Pay period
-   Pay types, for example, salary and wages, and paid leave
-   Gross pay, this is the amount before tax and any other deductions
-   Assessable income
-   Non-assessable income, if applicable.

Check your payslip if you’re unsure about the pre-filled details shown.

If any details are wrong or not pre-filled, you’ll have to make changes. Select either:

-   **Edit dates** to make changes to the pay period, you won’t be able to change the pay date
-   **Edit or add pay** to make changes to the pre-filled income details, or to add pay for this employer.

If you make changes, we may ask you to give us proof.

If you were paid more than once by this employer in the reporting period, we’ll show the pay details one at a time for you to review.

Select **Next** to continue.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-05/update-coa-report-employment-income-step2d-170523.png)

Select **Yes** or **No** to tell us if you need to add pay details for this employer.

If you select **Yes**, you can only add pay details for the Single Touch Payroll employer you’re currently editing. You can add any pay type that hasn’t been pre-filled if you were paid within the reporting period. This includes all income, such as bonuses, commission income and termination payments you got from your Single Touch Payroll employer.

Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step1k.png)

We’ll show you a summary of your pre-filled employer and pay details. Review each section to check all the details are correct.

If you manually added pay details, you’ll have the option to **Delete pay**. You can add them again if you entered them wrong.

If you need to make changes, select either:

-   **Edit employer** to make changes to your employer
-   **Edit details** to make changes to your pay.

If you make changes, we may ask you to give us proof.

Read the declaration. If you understand and agree with the declaration, select **I have read and agree with the terms and conditions**. Then select **Submit and continue**.

When you select Submit and continue, you’re only confirming the Single Touch Payroll employment details. You won’t be able to change these details after you submit them. After you submit, you must complete the rest of your report.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-05/update-coa-report-employment-income-step2f-170523.png)

We’ll let you know all of the following:

-   your gross pay was successfully added to your record
-   your employer’s details
-   the amount and date of your gross pay.

We won’t show any not assessable income you told us about earlier on this page. Income that is not assessable isn’t used to work out your rate of payment and entitlement.

Go to [Step 3](#step3) to continue your report.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step1m.png)

## Step 3: report non-pre-filled employment income

You can’t enter some employment income types, such as bonuses, commission income or termination payments for non-Single Touch Payroll employers. To tell us about other paid employment income, use the [Manage income and assets service](/centrelink-online-account-help-update-income-and-assets-details-your-other-income-details).

We may show some **Reporting tips** to help you report the right way. If you get this message, please read it, then select **Got it** to continue.

The Report Employment Income page will show all of the following:

-   any Single Touch Payroll income details you confirmed
-   your **reporting period**
-   a **Gross employment income** section for you and your partner
-   **Hours this period** section for you and your partner.

You can also select either of the following:

-   **Previous reports** to view and change income you reported for up to 6 of your past reporting periods. This doesn’t include Single Touch Payroll employers.
-   **Upcoming reporting periods** to view up to 6 of your future reporting periods.

If you’re on:

-   [scheduled reporting](/scheduled-reporting), submit your report on the date it’s due
-   [unscheduled reporting](/unscheduled-reporting), you can use this service any time to let us know what you’ve been paid. You need to do this within 14 days of being paid.

If you and your partner didn’t get paid any other employment income in your reporting period, select **Continue**, a Submit partial report message may appear. This is a prompt for you to check that everything you need to tell us is included. If you don’t need to include anything else, select **Yes** to continue.

If you have a Job Plan, go to [Step 4](#step4) to report your requirements.

If you don’t have a Job Plan, go to [Step 5](#step5) to review and submit your information, and then complete your report.

You need to include all of the following:

-   any gross income you were paid in the reporting period
-   any gross income your partner was paid in the reporting period
-   any gross income your employer back paid you or your partner
-   the hours both you and your partner worked, if required.

You may not need to report the hours worked. This depends on the payment type you and your partner get. If you don’t need to report hours worked, the Add hours option won’t show.

If you’re waiting for back pay, don’t report this as income until you get it.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step2c.png)

You can select one of the following:

### Add new employer

You can add a new employer for you or your partner.

Enter your employer’s **ABN** (Australian Business Number). You can find this on your payslip. Then select **Next**.

### Add pay

If you need help, read the information with the **question mark** icon on each page.

In this reporting period, if you or your partner got paid more than once by the same employer, you’ll need to add each pay separately. If you have more than one job, you’ll need to add the income you got from each employer separately.

Select the **calendar** icon and choose the date your employer paid you, as stated on your payslip. This date can be different to when the payment goes in your bank account. Or, enter it manually in the format of dd/mm/yyyy.

Enter the **Gross amount paid**, before tax and deductions. You can find this on your payslip. Use Australian dollars and cents, including the decimal point.

Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-11/coa-report-employment-income-step3j.png)

Select **Yes** or **No** to tell us if this pay includes any back pay.

Then select **Next**.

Select **Continue** to proceed.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step2m.png)

We’ll give you a summary of the details you’ve added.

Your total income for each employer will show in **Gross employment income** under **My pay**.

If you’ve reported your partner’s income, that will be under **My partner’s pay**.

On this page, you can change the details you’ve added in your reporting period. Select any of the following:

-   **Edit** if you need to change the non-pre-filled details you’ve given us for you and your partner

Select **Add hours** if you need to tell us the hours you or your partner worked for each employer during your reporting period.

You may not need to report the hours worked. This depends on the payment type you and your partner get. If you don’t need to report hours worked, the Add hours option won’t show. You can select **Continue** to proceed.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-05/coa-report-employment-income-step2o.png)

If you or your partner worked for more than one employer, select **Add more hours** to enter hours for other employers.

When you’ve finished adding your or your partner’s hours worked, select **Continue**.

If you have a Job Plan, go to [Step 4](#step4) to report your requirements.

If you don’t have a Job Plan, go to [Step 5](#step5) to review and submit your information, and then complete your report.
