If you’re leaving Australia to travel or live in another country, you need to tell us. Travelling outside of Australia may affect your payments.

You can only add your travel details one trip at a time. You’ll need to wait until you return from your first trip before you can add a new one.

You won’t be able to use this service if any dependent child or care receiver’s travel details don’t match your own. Read more about [payments while outside Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia).

Watch our video about how to advise of your travel outside of Australia using your Centrelink online account.
