If you get an eligible payment, we’ll write to you 13 weeks before you reach Age Pension age. The letter will invite you to apply to [transfer to Age Pension](/transfer-to-age-pension). If you get Centrelink letters online, your letter will go to your myGov Inbox. Our invitation to apply to transfer doesn’t mean you’re eligible for Age Pension. You’ll have to complete an eligibility check.

## Step 1: get started

There are 2 ways to transfer to Age Pension. You can start the process from either your:
