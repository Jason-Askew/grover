You can change your days and take them anytime within 2 years of your child’s birth or adoption. You can’t change days that have already passed.

You can take your days as any of the following:

-   a single block
-   multiple smaller blocks
-   single days
-   smaller blocks combined with single days.

You should choose days when you’re not working. If you worked on a day you chose to get Parental Leave Pay, please call our [Families line](/phone-us#families).

## Step 1: get started

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Centrelink**.

From your homepage, select **MENU**.
