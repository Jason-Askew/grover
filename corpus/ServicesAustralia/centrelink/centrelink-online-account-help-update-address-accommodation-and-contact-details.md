# Centrelink online account help - Update address, accommodation and contact details

Instructions on how to update your address, accommodation and contact details using your Centrelink online account.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#step1)
-   [Step 2: update address](#step2)
-   [Step 3: update accommodation details](#step3)
-   [Step 4: update contact details](#step4)
-   [Step 5: review and submit](#step5)
-   [Step 6: sign out](#step6)

You need to tell us if your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment). We can then assess your eligibility for payments and services. This includes telling us if your address, accommodation or contact details change.

If you’re leaving a relationship, or living with violence or abuse, there are some things you need to do to [keep your information safe](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship). It’s important to update your details in the right order so other people don’t have access to your information. This includes [updating your relationship status](/updating-your-relationship-status) before updating your contact details.

When you update your details, they may not show right away. You only need to make one update. We’ll make sure your details are updated correctly on your record.

## Step 1: get started

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Centrelink**.

Select **MENU** from your homepage.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step1a-090924.png)

Select **My details**, then **Personal and contact details**. You can then choose from:

-   **Update contact details**
-   **Update address details**
-   **Update accommodation details**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step1b-090924.png)

In this example, we’ll change the update address, accommodation and contact details in one update.

## Step 2: update address

It’s important we have a current mailing address. If you’re in the process of moving and you’re in-between home addresses, we want to keep your information safe.

You can tell us about a home address you are moving to in the future. We can only send your mail there from the date you’ve told us you’ll be living there. However, while you’re waiting for this to happen, it’s important you give us a secure mailing address. If you don’t, your mail will go to the last mailing address you gave us.

Select **Update address details**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2a-090924.png)

On the Update address, accommodation and contact details page, select **Update** for the address type you want to change. You can choose from:

-   **Home**
-   **Postal address**
-   **Temporary address** (if you’re living somewhere temporarily)
-   **Term address** (if you’re a student).

You can update more than one address type. Make sure you choose the correct address type for your update, as it may affect your eligibility for payments and services. If you need help, you can [contact us](/contact-us).

![](/sites/default/files/2023-10/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2b.png)

If we haven’t applied an update you previously made to your address, accommodation or contact details, a **Submitted updates** message will show.

Select **View details** to check your pending update.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-10/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2c.png)

The receipt shows details of when you submitted the update. You can select either:

-   **Save your receipt** to keep a copy of your receipt
-   **Return to homepage** to go back to your homepage.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2d-090924.png)

When you select an address type, you’ll have more options.

In this example we’ve chosen to update the home address.

Select either:

-   **Edit** to update your address
-   **Remove** to delete your address.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-10/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2e.png)

If you don’t have a current address recorded, select **Add**.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-10/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2f.png)

If you have a partner and they’re moving with you, we’ll update their address too. Make sure your **partner’s name** shows correctly. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to [contact us](/contact-us) before you change your address.

If your relationship status has changed, you must tell us. If you don’t, we may pay you the wrong amount and you’ll have to repay the money.

If you need help, read the information with the **question mark** icon.

Select **Begin** to continue.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2g-090924.png)

If you have a partner, we’ll ask you if they’re moving with you.

If your relationship status has changed, you’ll need to [contact us](/contact-us) immediately. A change in relationship status may affect your payments.

Select **Yes** or **No**, then **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-09/coa-update-address-accommodation-contact-details-step2h-090924.png)

Enter your **address**, including the house number and street name. When you start typing, you’ll be able to choose your street from the **dropdown** list.

### Get your receipt

-   your **nearest service centre**
-   **information** you need to know, based on your circumstances
-   **next steps** of what you may need to do.

The update you made may not show in your online account right away. You only need to make one update. We’ll make sure your details are updated correctly on your record.

We’ll also tell you if you need to complete any tasks to support your update. We’ll tell you how long you have to complete your task. You can give us the information using the Upload documents service in either:

-   the [Request a document](/centrelink-online-account-help-request-document) service in your Centrelink online account within 48 hours after we apply the update to your record
-   postal mail.

You don’t need to contact us unless we ask you to.

-   **Upload** to provide the information we’ve asked for
-   **Return to homepage** to go back to your online account homepage
