When you cancel your arrangement, we’ll send a letter to you and your nominee. The nominee will no longer have access to your online account. If this will put your safety at risk, please call us.

This online guide is for when a customer wants to cancel their nominee arrangement.

If you’re the nominee and want to cancel the arrangement, you must give this request to us in writing. To do this, it’s best to use the [Cancel Nominee Arrangement form](/ss532).

You can upload your request to your principal’s Centrelink online account by doing the following:

1.  Select the person you no longer want to be nominee for
2.  You’ll need to [upload documents](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online)
3.  Click Other documents, then choose Nominee Cancellation.
