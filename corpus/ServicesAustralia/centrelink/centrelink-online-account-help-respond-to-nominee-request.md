## Step 1: get started

[Sign in to myGov](https://my.gov.au/) and select Centrelink.

There are 2 ways to start, using either:

-   your [Tasks](#tasks)
-   the [MENU](#menu).

### Using tasks

From the **Review nominee appointment task**, select **Start task**.

## Step 3: accept nominee request

If you agree to be the person’s nominee, check the information on the **Review appointment details** page.

If the details are incorrect, you need to decline the request. Go to [Step 5](/centrelink-online-account-help-respond-to-nominee-request#step5).

If the details are correct, select **Accept**.

You need to use a verbal password when you contact us as a nominee. Your nominee password must be between 4 and 12 characters.

Enter and confirm your nominee password. Select **Next** and go to [Step 4](/centrelink-online-account-help-respond-to-nominee-request#step4) to review and submit your acceptance.

You can also select previous if you need to change any details.

## Step 4: submit declaration

Read the declaration. If you understand and accept the declaration, select **I have read and agree with the above conditions**, then **Submit**. Go to [Step 6](#step6) for your receipt.

You can also select the **home icon**, if you don’t want to continue or to start again.

## Step 5: decline nominee request

Decline the nominee request if your details are incorrect or you don’t want to be a nominee.

If the details about you are incorrect, tell the person who asked you to be their nominee. Give them your correct details so they can use them to re-nominate you.

We’ll ask you to check the details of the nominee request you’re declining.

To decline a nominee request, select **Decline** on the **Review appointment details** page, then **Next**.

If all the details are correct, read the declaration. If you understand and accept the declaration, select **I have read and agree with the above conditions**, then **Submit**.

You can select the **home icon** if you don’t want to continue or to start again.

Remember, if you declined the request because your details were incorrect, you must tell the person who nominated you. Please give them the right details and ask them to add you as a nominee again.

## Step 6: receipt

We’ll give you a Receipt ID to confirm your update. Make a note of this number for your records.

We’ll send a letter to the person who nominated you about your decision to accept. We send it online to their myGov Inbox. We’ll also put a message in the Pending Appointments section of their Nominee Arrangements page. It will be there for 21 days.

Select **Return to nominee arrangements** to go back to the **Nominee arrangements** page.
