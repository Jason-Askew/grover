If you have a Veteran Gold Card, you’ll need to call us on 132 300 to update your bank details.

If you have a [payment nominee](/centrelink-online-account-help-manage-where-your-payments-are-sent) you won’t be able to update your payment destination details online. You’ll need to [contact us](/centrelink-online-account-help-manage-where-your-payments-are-sent) to discuss your options.

Your payment destination is where you get your Centrelink payments. This can be a bank or another financial institution.

Before you start, make sure you have your new details including all the following:

-   BSB number
-   account number
-   account name.

We recommend keeping your old account open until you get your first payment in your new account.

You must use an account that is legally in your name. If you don’t have legal access to an account, [contact us](/contact-us).

## Step 2: change payment destination

The Payment Destination page shows your current account details. To protect your personal information, we’ll only show the last 4 digits of your account number. If you don’t recognise these details, [contact us](/phone-us).

If you get multiple payments, you can have each payment go to a different destination. You can choose to update more than one payment destination. In this example, we’ll update multiple payment destinations.

You can select **Home** if you don’t want to update your payment destination and go back to your homepage.

Select **Update payment destination**.
