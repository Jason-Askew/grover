# Centrelink online account help - How to use video chat for appointments

You can use video chat for some appointments using your Centrelink online account. Video chat appointments are available by offer only.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#a1)
-   [Step 2: open the video chat appointment](#a2)
-   [Step 3: sign out](#a3)

If you’ve been offered a video chat appointment, there’s some things you need to do before your video chat appointment. Your computer or mobile device must have a microphone, camera and access to the internet or data. Make sure you have these in place before booking a video appointment.

Your personal location may be clearly visible to Services Australia staff. Make sure you’re in a private location for the video chat and you’re comfortable with what’s being displayed.

You don’t need to download any video conferencing apps to attend the appointment.

Video chat won’t work in all internet browsers. Our video chats work best on either Microsoft Edge or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/intl/en_au/chrome/).

If you don’t have one of these browsers, you might need to download one if you’re experiencing issues. If the link opens in another browser, copy and paste the link into either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

We may ask you for feedback about your experience. Giving feedback is optional.

## Step 1: get started

Sign in to your Centrelink Online Account and go to **Manage appointments**.

Do this 5 minutes before your appointment time.

The video chat appointment details will show. Select **Join meeting**.
