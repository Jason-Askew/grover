You may have to pay tax if you get or will get any other taxable income in the tax year, such as income from employment. This guide will help you set up a voluntary tax amount we can deduct from your Centrelink payment. We’ll send these tax amounts to the Australian Tax Office (ATO).

The ATO will refund any tax amount we deduct from your payment that is more than the tax you need to pay. You’ll get this at the end of the tax year.
