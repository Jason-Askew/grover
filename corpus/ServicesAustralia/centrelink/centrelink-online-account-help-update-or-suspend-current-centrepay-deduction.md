-   when you want the changes to start from.

To finish updating the deduction, you have the following 3 options to choose from:

1.  This deduction will continue to be taken out of your payment until you tell us to stop.
2.  If you want the deduction to end soon please enter a date.
3.  Enter a target amount and we will stop after that amount is reached.

If you select to add an end date your deduction will stop on that date.

If you select to add a target amount your deduction will stop when you reach that amount.
