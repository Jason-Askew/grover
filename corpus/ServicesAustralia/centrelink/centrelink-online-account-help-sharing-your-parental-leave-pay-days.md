If you’re partnered, some Parental Leave Pay days will be reserved for your partner to use.

Parental Leave Pay days can be shared in a number of ways. To help, you can [learn who needs to approve and how to share Parental Leave Pay days](/sharing-your-parental-leave-pay?context=64479).

Once your partner or other parent has claimed Paid Parental Leave, a task will appear on your homepage. You’ll need to complete the task to confirm if you [give approval to share Parental Leave Pay](/giving-approval-to-share-parental-leave-pay?context=64479).

If we’re unable to locate your record when the other parent claims, they’ll be given a Temporary Access Code for you to verify your details before we can send the task. Find out more about [using this code if we can’t find your Centrelink online account](/giving-approval-to-share-parental-leave-pay?context=64479#cantfindcoa).

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Centrelink**. Select the **Request to share Parental Leave Pay** task on your homepage.

If you agree with the days that have been requested by your partner or another parent, select **Yes.** If you don’t agree, select **No**.

If you select **No,** we’ll ask how many days you want to give. You must share at least one day for their claim to be permitted.

Then select **Next**.
