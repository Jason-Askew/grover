If you have a [Centrelink debt or overpayment](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments), we want to help you repay it in a way that best suits your situation. You can pay back the money you owe by any of these methods:

-   credit or debit card (Visa or MasterCard only)

If you’re paying by BPAY, make sure you have your BPAY reference number.

If you’ve been impacted by a disaster or hardship event, you may be able to pause or change your debt repayments. Read more about the flexible choices available for [when you need to pause your debt repayments](/when-you-can-pause-your-debt-repayments).

## Step 2: make a payment

Select **Make a payment**.

If you need help, select **Help**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2a.png)

Select **Begin** to make a payment.

If you need help, read the information with the **question mark** icon on each page.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-04/coa-money-you-owe-step2b-120422.jpg)

Under How do you want to make a payment, you can select either:

-   Credit or Debit card (Visa or Mastercard only)
-   BPAY or Post Billpay.

Then select **Next**.

If you select Credit or Debit card (Visa or Mastercard only), make sure you have your card with you.

If you select BPAY or Post Billpay, we’ll give you the details you can print. Use these details to make a payment directly from your Australian bank account or at any Australia Post Outlet.

You can print the Post Billpay barcode or save a copy of the barcode to your mobile device. Don’t take a screenshot of the barcode as this may stop it from scanning at any Australia Post Outlet.

In this example, we’ll select **Credit or Debit card (Visa or Mastercard only)**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2c.png)

Select either:

-   Pay total amount to pay the total debt amount
-   Pay other amount to make a part payment.

When you select **Pay other amount** to make a part payment, you need to tell us how much you’re paying. **Enter the amount** you want to pay using Australian dollars, cents and a decimal point. Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2d.png)

Select **Continue** to proceed.

![](/sites/default/files/2020-12/update-money-you-owe-step3f-v2.png)

Select **Begin** to give us your credit or debit card details.

![](/sites/default/files/2020-12/update-money-you-owe-step2f-v2.png)

If you’re going to pay by BPAY or Post Billpay, we’ll give you a barcode or reference details. You can use these details to make your payment.

On the Card details page, enter all of your card details. You need to include all of the following:

-   **Card number**
-   **Card holder’s name**
-   **Expiry date** on the card, month and year
-   **Card verification code (CVC)**, the 3 digit number on the back of the card.

If the details you’ve entered are correct, select **Continue**.

If the details are wrong, enter them again to change.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2g.png)

For security purposes, your card issuer or financial institution will need additional details to process the payment.

The information you provide here won’t be stored by Services Australia or applied to your Centrelink record.

If you don’t want to provide additional details, you won’t be able to make a repayment using a credit or debit card. You can still make a repayment using a [different payment method](/if-youre-ready-to-start-repaying-money-you-owe).

Select **Begin** to provide additional details.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2h.png)

Select an option from the **dropdown** menu, then **Next** to continue.

In this example, we’ll select **Mobile phone**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2i.png)

Enter the **mobile phone** **number**, then select **Next**.

You must enter the international country code at the start of the number.

For example, if the phone number is an Australian:

-   mobile number of 0412 345 678, enter it as +61412345678
-   home or work number of 07 1234 5678, enter it as +61712345678.

### Review and submit

Select **Begin** to review and submit your repayment details.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2l.png)

We’ll give you a summary of the details you’ve given us. We’ll only show the last 4 digits of the card number.

Make sure **your details** are correct.

Select either:

-   **Edit details** to make changes if the details are wrong
-   **Next** if the details are correct.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-09/coa-manage-the-money-you-owe-step2n.png)

After you select submit, your card issuer or financial institution may ask you to complete additional actions to process your payment. Please don’t sign out of your Centrelink online account or close your browser window.

Please wait until you get a receipt from us to let you know if your payment has been processed.
