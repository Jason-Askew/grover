This guide is for Australian residents, [New Zealand citizens living in Australia](/new-zealand-citizens-claiming-payments-australia) or [those who meet other residence rules](/residence-rules-for-natural-disaster-support) who need to claim the [Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment](/natural-disaster-support) or New Zealand Disaster Recovery Payment for a natural disaster event.

Information about these and other payments is detailed on the [disaster event](/natural-disaster-support) pages.

To claim online, you need a myGov account with Centrelink linked to it.

If you’re a nominee, you won’t be able to claim this payment online for customers you’re a nominee for.

If you can’t use your Centrelink online account, you can call us on the [Emergency information line](#toolbar-phone) for help claiming this payment.
