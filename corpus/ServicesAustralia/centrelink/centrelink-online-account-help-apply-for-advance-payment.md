-   the amount advanced to you
-   your fortnightly repayment amount
-   the amount yet to be paid
-   when you can apply for your next possible advance.

If you aren’t eligible to apply for an advance payment, we’ll tell you:

-   why you’re not eligible
-   when you may be eligible to apply.

Depending on the type of advance, you can get your advance payment as either:

-   one instalment
-   2 instalments.

If you want us to pay you in 2 instalments, you’ll need to tell us:

-   the amount of your first instalment
-   the date you would like the second instalment.

In this example, we’ll choose to be paid in 2 instalments. Enter these details, then select **Next**.

If you’re applying for a Family Tax Benefit advance, we can only pay this in one instalment.

We’ll give you a summary of the details you’ve provided.

We’ll also tell you your fortnightly repayment amount. Your repayment is taken from the amount we’d normally pay you. You don’t need to do anything to set this up.

Read the details on this page and make sure they’re correct, then select **Next**. If you need to make changes, select **Update**.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-11/update-og-apply-advance-payment-step4b.png) If all the information is correct, read the declaration. If you understand and agree with the declaration, select **I have read and agree with the above conditions**, then **Submit**.

## Step 5: get your receipt

We’ll give you a receipt to let you know your application has been processed. Make a note of the **Receipt ID** for your records.

You don’t need to contact us about your advance payment unless we ask you to.
