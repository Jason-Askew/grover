# Centrelink online account help - Update your family income estimate

Make sure your family income estimate is accurate to help you to avoid being overpaid or underpaid.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#step1)
-   [Step 2: update your family income estimate](#step2)
-   [Step 3: confirm update to family income estimate](#step3)
-   [Step 4: view your family income history](#step4)

We use your family income estimate to work out how much family assistance you get. Family assistance includes Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Subsidy. Find out more about your [family income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments).

If you get Child Care Subsidy, you may also need to [update your recognised participation](/hours-subsidised-child-care-for-child-care-subsidy).

If you or your partner get an [income support payment](/income-support-payment), you’ll need to [report changes in your income or earnings](/employment-income-reporting) separately for that payment. Income support payments may include:

-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment)
-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
-   [Austudy](/austudy)
-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Age Pension](/age-pension).

If you get an income support payment from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, you need to include this too. This may include:

-   Age Pension
-   Income Support Supplement
-   Service Pension
-   Veteran Payment.

## Step 1: get started

[Sign into myGov](https://my.gov.au/) and select **Centrelink**.

Select **MENU** from your homepage.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step1a.png)

Select **My family**, then **Family assistance** and **Family income estimate**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step1b.png)

This will take you to a page that shows your family income estimate for the current financial year.

From April to June of each year, you can also provide your family income estimate for the next financial year. Select the tab with the financial year you want to update.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step1c.png)

Remember, updating your annual income estimate for family assistance doesn’t update your income for income support payments. You may also need to [report changes in your income or earnings](/employment-income-reporting) separately. You need to do this if you or your partner get an income support payment such as:

-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment)
-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
-   [Austudy](/austudy)
-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Age Pension](/age-pension).

## Step 2: update your family income estimate

To update your income estimate, move down the page and select **Update income estimate**.

If you have a partner, you’ll need to update their income estimate as well. Your partner’s income estimate will show below your income estimate.

Make sure you’re aware of [what to include in your income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments#whatincludeest). There are some payments you don’t need to include like [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit), [Remote Area Allowance](/remote-area-allowance), [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance), [Energy Supplement](/energy-supplement) and [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance).

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step2a.png)

Select **Begin** after confirming the income year you selected to update.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step2b.png)

Enter your estimated income amounts into the boxes. If something doesn’t apply to you, leave that box as $0.

Alerts will appear at the top of the page to help you.

When you’ve entered your amounts, select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step2c.png)

If an amount you’ve entered doesn’t match our records, we’ll need you to tell us more information. A message will appear at the top of the page. It lets you know what you need to do.

If you have a partner, enter their amounts, then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step2d.png)

Select **Continue** to save your changes and proceed.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step2e.png)

Review your income estimate update and select **Continue** to save your changes and proceed.

## Step 3: confirm update to family income estimate

If your income has gone down, you may need to tell us why. Select **Begin** to continue.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3a.png)

This helps us to verify your estimate is reasonable. You can do this using the **dropdown** menu, then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3b.png)

Select **Continue** to save your changes and proceed.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3c.png)

Select **Begin** to review the information you’ve given us.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3d.png)

Review each section to check the details are correct. If all the details are correct, select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3e.png)

If you need to make changes, select **Edit income estimate**. If all the details are correct, select **Next**.

If all the details are correct, read the declaration. If you understand and agree with the declaration, select **I understand and accept the above declaration**. Then select **Submit**.

![](/sites/default/files/2026-01/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3f.png)

We’ll give you a **Receipt ID** when you submit your update. Make a note of this number for your records. Select **Return home** to go back to your homepage.

![](/sites/default/files/2026-01/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step3g.png)

## Step 4: view your family income history

You can view your family income history.

Select **MENU** from your homepage.

Select **My family**, then **Family income estimate**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step4a.png)

Move down the page and select **View your family income history**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step4b.png)

Select the **financial** **year** of your family income history you’d like to view.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step4c.png)

You can view a list of the past estimates you provided and the income we’ve used, if your payments have been balanced. When you’ve finished, select **Return home**.

![](/sites/default/files/2025-03/coa-update-family-income-estimate-step4d.png)

## Step 5: next steps

When you update your income estimate, you should also consider if anything else has changed.

If you get Child Care Subsidy, you may also need to [update your recognised participation](/hours-subsidised-child-care-for-child-care-subsidy).

You can also update your [Family Tax Benefit payment choices](/centrelink-online-account-help-update-your-family-tax-benefit-ftb-payment-choices). To help avoid an overpayment, we’ll recommend a payment choice for you based on your circumstances.

## Step 6: sign out

From your homepage, you can complete other transactions or select **Return to myGov** to go back to your myGov account.
