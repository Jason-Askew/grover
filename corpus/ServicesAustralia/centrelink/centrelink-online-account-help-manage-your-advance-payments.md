To pay some or all of the advance payment you owe, select **Make a repayment**.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-12/update-og-manage-advance-step2a.png)

Read the information about making a repayment, then select **Begin**.

![](/sites/default/files/2023-12/update-og-manage-advance-step2b.png)

Select how you want to make the repayment, choose either:

-   Credit or debit card (Visa or MasterCard only)
-   Post Billpay.

Then select **Next**.

If you select Credit or debit card, make sure you have your card with you.

Credit or debit card payments can only be made once every 28 days for each advance type.

If you select Post Billpay, you can make a payment at any Australia Post Outlet. You can pay with cash, a credit or debit card, cheque or money order. You’ll need to either:

-   print the Post Billpay barcode
-   save a copy of the barcode to your mobile device.

You can only use the barcode for this payment. Don’t take a screenshot of the barcode as this may stop it from scanning at any Australia Post Outlet.

If you pay with cash or card, your record will update instantly. Payments made with cheque or money order can take up to 7 working days to process.

In this example, we’ll select **Credit or debit card**, then **Next**.

-   Pay other amount.

If you don’t want to provide additional details, you won’t be able to make a repayment using a credit or debit card. You can still make a repayment using a [different payment method](/if-youre-ready-to-start-repaying-money-you-owe).

When you make a payment with a credit or debit card, you won’t be able to make another payment with a card for 28 days for this advance type. You can still make a payment at any Australia Post Office.
