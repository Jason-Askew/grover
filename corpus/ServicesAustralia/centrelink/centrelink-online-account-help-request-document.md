You can request any of the following documents depending on what payments you get or got in the past:

-   Application for Payment form
-   Australian employment income details
-   Centrelink payment details
-   Centrelink statement
-   Deduction statement
-   Detailed income and asset statement

-   Medical certificate information
-   Payment summary
-   Rent Certificate
-   Replacement concession card
-   Reporting statement, if you have reporting requirements
-   Settlement statement
-   Statement of debt

When you update your accommodation details online, we may ask you to give us a rent certificate. We’ll send you the certificate, which you’ll need to complete and return to us. It can take up to 48 hours for your certificate to become available in the **Request a document service** after we apply the update to your record.

Select the **document type** you need from the dropdown menu.

In this example, we’ll request an **Income statement**.

We’ll give you a Receipt ID when you submit your request. The Receipt page may give you **a link to your document** in PDF format. You can view, print or save the PDF. If you’re subscribed to get your letters online, we’ll send you a copy of the document. You’ll get it in your myGov Inbox.

If we don’t give you a link to your document in PDF format straight away, we’ll send a notification to your myGov Inbox when it’s available.

If you request a statement of debt, you’ll need to enter a beginning and end date. You won’t be able to access it straight away. If you’re subscribed to get your letters online, we’ll send it to your myGov Inbox on the following business day.

If you request a replacement concession card, we’ll mail it to your postal address. You can access a digital copy of your card using either the:

-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app/using-the-mygov-app).
