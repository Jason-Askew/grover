# Centrelink online account help - Advise non-lodgement of tax return

Instructions on how to tell us that you or your partner don’t need to lodge a tax return for the previous financial year using your Centrelink online account.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#a1)
-   [Step 2: select the financial year](#a2)
-   [Step 3: tell us about your situation](#a3)
-   [Step 4: give us your income details](#a4)

Use this service if you got [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) (FTB) or [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) (CCS) in a previous financial year.

So we can balance your FTB or CCS you need to tell us both of the following:

-   if you or your partner are not required to lodge a tax return
-   your or your partner’s income for a previous financial year, if a tax return is not required.

-   [advising non-lodgement of a tax return](/advising-non-lodgement-tax-return?context=22151)
-   [balancing your family assistance payments](/balancing-your-family-assistance-payments).

If you’re not sure if you need to lodge a tax return, there’s help available. Use the [Do I need to lodge a tax return?](https://www.ato.gov.au/calculators-and-tools/tax-return-do-i-need-to-lodge) tool on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) website.

If you or your partner don’t need to lodge a tax return, the ATO also needs to know. Find out how to [Lodge a non-lodgment advice](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/your-tax-return/how-to-lodge-your-tax-return/lodge-a-non-lodgment-advice) on the ATO website.

**Before you start**, we recommend you work out the gross income you got in the financial year. You can find this information on your [Centrelink Payment Summary](/centrelink-payment-summary) or on Payment Summaries provided by your employer. These can also be found in your ATO online account in myGov.

If you’re advising non-lodgement for your partner, you’ll need to get this information from them.

## Step 4: give us your income details

You’ll need to tell us your taxable income details.

If your employer does their payroll through Single Touch Payroll we’ll show this income as salary and wages. If you’re sure the amount shown is correct, you need to enter that amount. If it’s not correct, enter the correct amount. If the income amount shown is not correct, you should follow this up with your employer. Read more about [Single Touch Payroll](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/hiring-and-paying-your-workers/single-touch-payroll) on the ATO website.

If you got a [taxable payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment) from us, we’ll include this amount for you under taxable government payments. You can’t enter a lower amount than what we paid.

If you were affected by a [declared natural disaster](/natural-disaster-support) and got a government payment, you may need to include this as income.

If you got Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment (PLDP) this won’t be prefilled. You must include this amount when you confirm your income.

Read more about tax treatment of these payments at [reporting disaster payments and grants in your tax return](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/financial-difficulties-and-disasters/support-in-difficult-times/support-from-other-agencies/reporting-disaster-payments-and-grants-in-your-tax-return) on the ATO website.

You must also add in taxable payments you got from another government department. For example, this may include certain payments from Veterans’ Affairs. Read more about [government payments and allowances](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/income-deductions-offsets-and-records/income-you-must-declare/government-payments-and-allowances) on the ATO website.

You might get some payments from us that aren’t taxable. You don’t need to include any of the following as part of your income details:

-   Family Tax Benefit
-   Child Care Subsidy
-   Rent Assistance
-   child support received
-   Carer Allowance
-   Economic Support Payments
-   Cost of Living Payment
-   COVID-19 Disaster Payments.

Enter the correct amount at each of the following fields:

-   **Taxable salary and wages**
-   **Taxable government payments**
-   **Other taxable income (profit or loss)**.

Then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2022-07/coa-advise-non-lodgement-step4b-010722.png)

Enter the correct amount in whole dollars, then select **Next**.

We’ll ask if you had tax withheld on any income you got in the financial year.

Select either:

-   **Yes** if you had tax withheld
-   **No** if you didn’t have tax withheld.

Then select **Next**.

### Other income details

You’ll need to tell us your other income details. If you had any other income, enter it next to the correct income type. Select the **question mark** icon next to the income type to read more information about it.

We may display other income from your employer that is reported through Single Touch Payroll. If you’re sure the amount displayed is correct, you need to enter that amount. If it’s not correct, enter the correct amount. If the income amount shown is not correct, you should follow this up with your employer. Read more about [Single Touch Payroll](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/hiring-and-paying-your-workers/single-touch-payroll) on the ATO website.

If you got a Centrelink tax-free pension or benefit, we’ll include this amount for you. You can’t enter a lower amount than what we paid.

If you got tax-free payments from another government department, you may need to add these in. For example, certain payments from Veterans’ Affairs. Read more about [Tax Free Pensions and Benefits](/what-adjusted-taxable-income).

To make updates, select the income type you want to update.

Enter the correct amounts in whole dollars, then select **Next**.

You can check the status of your FTB and CCS balancing using your Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.
