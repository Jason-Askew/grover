# Supporting documents

When claiming Age Pension, we’ll ask you for some supporting documents to support your claim for Age Pension.

-   [Why you need to give us documents](#whygiveusdocuments)
-   [Which documents you must give us](#whichdocumentsmustgive)
-   [Which documents you may need to give us](#whichdocumentsmaygive)
-   [How to submit your documents](#a4)
-   [When we need documents after you submit your claim](#documentsaftersubmitclaim)

## Why you need to give us documents

We need supporting documents to confirm information you tell us in your claim. We can’t assess your claim without them. We may also ask you for more details after you submit your claim. We’ll let you know what you need to give us and when you need to do it by.

If you don’t give us these documents, it could delay your claim. If you miss the deadline to give us any extra documents we ask for, we may reject your claim.

## Which documents you must give us

You must give us the following details before or when you submit your claim. If you’ve already provided these, you may not need to do so again. Documents that show:

-   your age
-   your bank account details
-   your tax file number
-   your Australian residence status, unless you’re an Australian citizen who was born in Australia
-   if you’re [member of a couple](/updating-your-relationship-status)
-   your income and assets.

If you claim online, we list the documents you have to provide in the required task list.

If you complete a paper claim, we’ll tell you next to the question what information or document we need.

Before you submit your claim, you may need to give us your identity documents so we can [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=22526). Having them ready will help you finish your claim and not delay the process

## Which documents you may need to give us

When you start your claim, we’ll tell you the documents we need. This will depend on the information you tell us.
