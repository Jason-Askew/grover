If a task is Required you must complete it before you can submit your claim.

If the task is Supplementary, you don’t need to give us these documents with your claim. But, if you do, it’ll help us work out if you’re entitled to other payments and services.

Depending on your situation, we’ll let you know if you can submit your claim before completing all Required tasks.
