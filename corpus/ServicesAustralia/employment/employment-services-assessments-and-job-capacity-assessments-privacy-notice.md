## Why we collect your personal information

We may collect your personal information through assessments and from the following agencies:

-   Department of Social Services (DSS)
-   Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR)
-   National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA).

We collect this information so we can conduct assessments. We may use these to inform decisions regarding your payments and allowances.

An ESAt is an assessment to help us understand your barriers to work and your capacity to work. This helps us determine what type of employment services provider is best for you. Learn more about [Employment Services Assessments](/employment-services-assessments?context=51411).

A JCA is a comprehensive assessment of your level of functional impairment and work capacity. We often use these assessments if you’ve recently submitted a claim for Disability Support Pension. Learn more about [Job Capacity Assessments](/job-capacity-assessment-for-disability-support-pension).

If we can’t collect all or some of your personal information, we may not be able to do any of the following:

-   complete your assessment
-   determine your eligibility for a payment
-   determine suitable mutual obligation requirements for you.

The collection of your personal information may be required or authorised by law. For more information see Section 63 of the [_Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00580/latest/text).

## How we manage your information

We collect your personal information so we can provide you with services and payments, and to assess your eligibility to participate in programs or services provided by other government agencies.

We follow strict laws and must comply with the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Commonwealth).

We may use your personal information with automated decision-making systems and tools. These help us provide you with the services and undertake the activities described in this privacy notice. If we use these systems and tools, we’ll comply with all applicable laws when doing so. Our use of these systems and tools doesn’t affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.

## Who we may share your information with

As part of our work, we sometimes need to share your information. We only share your information with other parties where you’ve agreed, or where the law allows or requires it.

To inform key recommendations within an ESAt or JCA, we may need to:

-   talk to your treating healthcare professionals
-   refer you for a Specialist Assessment with a health and allied-health professional.

If we need to refer you to an employment services provider, we’ll share some information with them. We might refer you to an employment services provider when:

-   you’ve requested a voluntary referral
-   you’re looking for work while getting a payment from us.

We may also share your information with any of the following agencies:

-   DSS
-   DEWR
-   NIAA.

We generally don’t disclose your personal information to overseas recipients.

## What information we’ll share

We may share information from your assessment report. An ESAt or JCA report will include details about:

-   your medical conditions
-   your barriers to work
-   recommended interventions
-   your capacity to work due to disability, illness or injury
-   whether a referral to an employment services provider is appropriate, and what type of employment services provider is best for you.

### Personal details

Personal information could include:

-   contact details such as your name, address, phone number, date of birth

-   whether you have a criminal record.

### Medical condition details

We may need to share details of your medical conditions if they affect your ability to work or participate in employment services.

This may include:

-   diagnosis of medical conditions reported by your treating doctor or health practitioners
-   whether the impacts of your medical conditions are likely to persist for more or less than 2 years
-   treatment you receive for your medical conditions
