For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

We may still pay you Carer Payment if you do either of the following for up to 100 hours in a 4 week period:

-   paid work
-   self-employed work.

The 100 hours doesn’t include the following activities and you don’t need to report them:

-   travel time to and from your paid work or self-employment
-   study
-   training
-   volunteering.

The 100 hours only includes time spent working where you are not providing care. This can include hours worked from home if you cannot stop working when the person you care for needs help.

You must still provide care for a significant period each day.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can check your work hours summary online. To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Payments and Claims**, then **Manage payments**.
3.  Select **View Work hours summary**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you can [create them](/create-online-account).

You must tell us within 14 days if you start work, change your hours or get income from work or self-employment.

Any income you get can reduce the amount we pay you. Learn more about [employment income reporting](/employment-income-reporting?context=21816).

If you have a job you may be able to get [Working Credit](/working-credit?context=21816). It increases how much you can earn before we start reducing your payments.

## Options if you work more than 100 hours

You have options available if you work more than 100 hours in a 4 week period.

### Using respite days

If you sometimes work more than 100 hours in a 4 week period, you’ll be able to use respite days so you can keep your payment.

You can access up to 63 days of respite in a calendar year.

To learn about respite days and how to use them, find out more about [breaks from caring](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

### Suspending your Carer Payment

We can suspend your payment for up to 6 months if you:

-   work over 100 hours in a 4 week period and don’t use respite days
-   run out of respite days
-   earn too much income from employment.

If your payment is suspended we’ll send you a letter to let you know.

If you’ve set up your myGov Inbox, we’ll send you an SMS or email to let you know there’s a new letter. Otherwise, we’ll send you a letter in the post.

We’ll tell you the start and end dates of the suspension period. Learn how to [set your online account notifications](/set-your-notifications-for-centrelink-letters-online).

You won’t need to report your employment income while your payment is suspended.

You can also keep your [Pensioner Concession Card](/pensioner-concession-card) while your payment is suspended.

### Restoring your Carer Payment

You can ask us to restore your payment if either of the following apply within the 6 month suspension period:

-   your work hours or income reduce
-   you stop working.

If this happens, call us on the [disability, sickness and carers line](/phone-us#peoplewithdisability) or visit a [service centre](/find-us#visitingservice) and ask for your payment to be restored.

You must contact us within the period on the letter or email we sent you. If you don’t contact us within this time you will need to submit a new claim.

## Parent Pathways for parents or carers

You’ll work with a mentor who will support you during your time with Parent Pathways. You’ll also get tailored advice, guidance and resources in a supportive and safe environment, where your children are always welcome.
