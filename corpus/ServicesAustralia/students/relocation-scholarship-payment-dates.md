# Payment dates

We pay Relocation Scholarship once a year.

## on this page

-   [In your first year of the scholarship](#a1)
-   [After the first year](#a2)
-   [Example - when your parents move](#a3)
-   [If your circumstances change](#a4)

You need to meet all the [eligibility](/who-can-get-relocation-scholarship?context=22566) rules before we pay it.

Your payment won’t show up in your online account or in the app until we’ve paid it.

## In your first year of the scholarship

Once you’re eligible you’ll get the scholarship with your next Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY Living Allowance payment of at least $1.

It doesn’t matter what time of year you become eligible. We’ll pay as long as there are at least 35 days before the end of your course.

## After the first year

You’ll get the scholarship with your first Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY Living Allowance payment of at least $1 after 21 February.

## Example - when your parents move

Stan is currently studying full time in an approved course at a regional university and lives with his parents. In August his parents move to a different regional town. Stan goes to live on campus to continue his course.

He can now get the away from home rate of Youth Allowance and a Relocation Scholarship. He still has 2 years of study left, so he’ll be in full time study 35 days after he became eligible.

Next time he gets at least $1 of Youth Allowance, he’ll get the scholarship at the same time.

## If your circumstances change

You need to tell us if your [circumstances change](/tell-us-about-changes-if-you-get-relocation-scholarship?context=22566) so we pay you the right amount.

Tell us:

-   if your parents’ address changes after you qualify for the scholarship - this may impact your payment rate
-   if your place of study changes.
