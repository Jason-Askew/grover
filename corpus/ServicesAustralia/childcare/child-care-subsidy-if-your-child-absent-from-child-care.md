# If your child is absent from child care

We may pay Child Care Subsidy (CCS) if you’re charged for child care when your child is absent.

When your child is going to be absent from child care, you need to let your service know. It’s important you tell them so they can accurately record the absence. If they don’t do this, we can’t pay your CCS correctly.

## How many absences you can get

You can get up to 42 allowable absence days per child each financial year.

If you reach your allowable absence limit, you may be able to get additional absences. You may get additional absences if any of these apply:

-   your child is ill
-   your child’s carer or their partner or another person your child lives with is ill
-   your child is attending preschool
-   alternative arrangements have been made for your child on a pupil-free day
-   your child hasn’t been immunised against an infectious disease and the absence occurs during an immunisation grace period
-   your child is spending time with a person other than their usual carer as required by a court order or parenting plan
-   your child’s child care service is closed because of an event for which a CCS period of emergency has been declared
-   your child can’t attend because of an event for which a CCS period of emergency has been declared
-   your child’s carer chooses not to send the child because of an event for which a CCS period of emergency has been declared.

Talk to your child care service about this. You may need to give them supporting documents.

You may be eligible for extra allowable absences if you live in a region where a CCS period of emergency has been declared. Find out more about what a CCS period of emergency is and how to get extra absences [if you’re affected by an emergency](/child-care-subsidy-if-youre-affected-emergency?context=41186).

If you have both allowable and special purpose absences available, the special purpose absences will be used first.

## When you can use absences

You can only use absence days for days your child would normally attend child care and get CCS. This includes public holidays.

You can use absence days for any reason, including if the child is on a holiday. You don’t need to provide evidence for any absences you use under the allowable absence limit.

### Tracking your absences

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can track your absences online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Child Care** from the **My Family** menu.
3.  Select **Absences**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app). Select your child’s name from the **Child Care Subsidy** menu option, then **Absences**.

## When you can use absence days before your child attends child care or after their last day of attendance

We generally won’t pay CCS for any absences before your child physically attends or after the last day your child physically attends child care. You’ll need to pay full fees for these days.

However, if you have an approved reason, we’ll pay CCS for absences that occur up to 6 days at the start or the end of an enrolment. The absence days must occur in the 6 days before the first or after the last day of attendance.

Approved reasons include any of these:

-   any of the [additional absence reasons](https://www.education.gov.au/early-childhood/child-care-subsidy/absences) on the Department of Education website
-   your child’s child care service has changed ownership
-   your child’s usual child care service is closed and the child attends a different service under the same child care provider
-   your child’s enrolment ceased incorrectly
-   you’ve experienced a family tragedy.

You should talk to your service about these absence reasons and about using these absence days. Your service may ask you to provide evidence.

If your child hasn’t attended child care for 14 weeks in a row, both of the following will apply:

-   your enrolment with the child care service will end
-   we won’t pay any absences after the last day your child physically attended care.

Find out more about what happens [if we end your enrolment](/changing-your-child-care-subsidy-enrolment-details?context=41186#endenrolment).

## When your child doesn’t use child care

Enrolments with your child care service will end if your child hasn’t attended child care for 14 weeks in a row. If your child hasn’t used child care at least once in the previous 26 weeks, they’ll stop being eligible for the payment. This includes the first 26 weeks following the start of your CCS. If you have shared care arrangements for your child, your 26 week period will be calculated based on the sessions of care you’re responsible for paying for.

We’ll reassess your family if one or more of your children stop using child care. We’ll check to see if any other children still using child care can get the [higher CCS rate](/your-number-children-care-can-affect-your-higher-child-care-subsidy?context=41186).

If you decide not to use child care, you can contact us to end your child’s CCS eligibility.

If your child starts to attend care again, you’ll need to [submit a new claim for CCS](/how-to-claim-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) and re-enrol them with your child care service.

Find out more about [if you want to re-enrol your child in the same service](/changing-your-child-care-subsidy-enrolment-details?context=41186#reenrolsameservice).

## Examples of what happens when your child is absent from child care

Learn more about different examples of when your child is absent from child care and how this will affect your CCS.

When your child has not yet attended the service

Lucy’s child Adam started primary school on 4 February. She enrolled Adam to start before school care on the same day.

On 4 February Lucy decided to take Adam to school for his first day, missing his first day of before school care. Because there wasn’t an approved reason for Adam missing before school care on 4 February, Lucy needs to pay full fees for that session.

This means we started paying CCS from 5 February when Adam attended before school care for the first time.

When you secure a place but your child hasn’t attended day care yet

There’s a vacancy at Tim’s day care centre for one day a week from 17 December. Tim accepts so he doesn’t lose the place and tells the child care service his child will start on 7 January.

The child care centre start charging him fees to reserve a place until his child starts, including when they’re closed for the holidays. Reserving a place at a child care centre isn’t an approved reason. We’ll start paying CCS from 7 January when his child attends their first day at child care.

When your child stops attending day care before their enrolment ends

Ivana’s child is enrolled in day care until 12 April. Ivana lets the day care service know they’re going on holiday and her child’s last day attending will be on 9 April.

Ivana’s child physically attends day care for the last time on 9 April. Taking a holiday isn’t an approved reason for her child to stop attending day care early so Ivana will need to pay full fees for 10 to 12 April.

When your child stops attending the service before their enrolment ends

Brad’s child Emma is enrolled in day care until the end of the year. Emma will attend the same day care next year for 2 days a week under a new enrolment. The last day of Emma’s current enrolment is 20 December. Brad contacts the service to let them know Emma can’t attend on that day.

In most circumstances, we won’t pay CCS for a child who doesn’t attend the last day of their enrolment period. However, Brad speaks to his service and they confirm CCS will be paid on 20 December as they agree to record this as an approved absence. The service confirmed he met an approved reason.

How absences can be affected when your child’s enrolment ends

Julian has enrolled his child Mark in day care. Julian lets his child care service know they’re going on an extended holiday and Marks last day will be 15 July. They want to keep their current enrolment so they don’t lose their spot with the service.

Mark physically attends for the last time on 15 July. Julian’s enrolment ends after Mark hasn’t attended for 14 weeks in a row. Because Julian doesn’t have an approved reason for the absences, he’ll need to pay full fees for any absences after Mark last attended day care.

Julian will need to talk to his child care service as he may owe money for the absences paid that he wasn’t entitled to.

When your child hasn’t attended child care in the first 26 weeks

Caroline will be returning to work in the coming months and wants to send her child Archie to child care. She submits a claim for CCS on 27 January, which is granted and backdated to 6 January.

Caroline then decides to delay her return to work and no longer needs to send Archie to child care. 26 weeks pass and Archie hasn’t attended child care. Their CCS stops on 7 July, 26 weeks from the start of their CCS on 6 January, because Archie is no longer eligible.

Caroline will need to submit a new claim for CCS if she decides to send Archie to child care in the future.
