# Medicare services for rural and remote Australians

We can help you get health care if you live in a rural or remote area.

-   [Accessing Medicare in your location](#a2)
-   [Finding other health services](#a3)

## Seeing a doctor

If you live in a rural or remote area, you can find your nearest [bulk billing](/bulk-billing?context=60092) GP or doctor by using the [find a health service tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) on the healthdirect website.

Keep in mind, we don’t cover the cost of travel to medical appointments.

### Video medical appointments

If you live a long way from a major city, you may be able to see a doctor by video instead. You can also use the [find a health service tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) to check if they do telehealth video appointments. We can help pay for video appointments with some GPs and specialists.

Video appointments can happen at:

-   your GP
-   an Aboriginal Medical Service
-   a residential aged care home
-   your home if the specialist agrees.

You can ask for a GP or health worker to be in the room with you during the video call.

### Cost of appointments

Ask your doctor how much the appointment is likely to cost.

If your doctor bulk bills, you won’t need to pay anything. If they don’t, you’ll have to pay for the appointment. You’ll often be able to claim some of this money back from us.
