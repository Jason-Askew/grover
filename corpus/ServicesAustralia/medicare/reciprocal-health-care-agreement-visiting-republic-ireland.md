It must be:

-   medically necessary care that can’t wait till you get home
-   within 12 months after you arrive.

You’ll still need to pay a fee for each service.

## What’s covered

It covers:

-   care as a public patient in a public hospital
-   maternity care
-   part of the cost of prescription medicines if you spend over a set amount in 1 month.

## What it doesn’t cover

It doesn’t cover:

-   accommodation as a private patient in a private or public hospital
-   care as a private patient - this includes as a private patient in a public hospital
-   prescription medicines below a set amount in 1 month
-   anything you arranged before you got to Ireland
-   visits to a GP.

Your travel insurance may cover some of these and other extra costs.

## What to do

When you go to get health care:

-   show your passport and your valid Medicare card
-   pay the fee for the non-free part of the cost.

Keep all your receipts for medicines.
