You can claim all Medicare services that aren’t bulk billed.

With your claim you need to submit details of:

-   the services you’re claiming for
-   how much you paid.

You’ll find this information on your invoice or your receipt from your health professional.

You also need to send us a copy of your invoice and receipt with your claim. To do this, scan or take a photo of these documents and save them.

Upload your files as a PDF, JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP format less than 5MB in size.

Take extra care if you’re using a public computer to scan and upload your documents. After you complete your claim, delete your documents from the public computer.

We’ll need your bank account details to pay your Medicare benefit. Find out more about how to [update your bank account details](/medicare-online-account-help-update-your-bank-account-details).

We can’t accept online claims for services over 2 years old.
