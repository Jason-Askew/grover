# PBS Safety Net thresholds

Once you or your family spend a certain amount on PBS medicine you’ll reach the PBS Safety Net threshold.

We calculate the PBS Safety Net in a calendar year. It usually resets at the beginning of each year, 1 January.

On 1 January 2026, the PBS Safety Net thresholds were updated to:

-   $277.20 for concession card holders
-   $1,748.20 for general patients.

Before you meet the threshold, each medicine will cost up to:

-   $7.70 for concession card holders
-   $25.00 for general patients.

Once you reach the threshold, you’ll need to apply for a [PBS Safety Net card](/pbs-safety-net-card-application?context=22016) to get cheaper medicines.

Your medicine will then either:

-   be free for concession card holders
-   cost up to $7.70 for general patients.

When there are 2 or more brands of the same medicine, they may have different prices. If you choose a more expensive brand it may cost you more.
