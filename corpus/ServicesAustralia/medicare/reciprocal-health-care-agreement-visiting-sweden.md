# Visiting Sweden

The Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) we have with Sweden may cover some of your medical costs in the Swedish public health system.

It must be medically necessary care that can’t wait till you get home.

Adults will still need to pay a small fee for each service.

## What’s covered

It covers:

-   care from a doctor
-   care as an out-patient at a hospital
-   free health services for children
-   free maternity services
-   part of the cost of prescription medicines.

## What it doesn’t cover

It doesn’t cover daily fees for staying in a hospital.

Your travel insurance may cover these and other extra costs.

## What to do

Be ready to show your passport and Medicare card.
