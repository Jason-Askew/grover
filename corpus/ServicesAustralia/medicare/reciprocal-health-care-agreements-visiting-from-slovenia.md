# Visiting from Slovenia

If you’re visiting Australia from Slovenia you may be eligible for medical care under Medicare while you’re here.

## Who can get it

To be eligible for Medicare under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA), you must be insured in the Slovenian health system. This includes citizens and non-citizens of Slovenia.

If you’re here on a student visa, you’re eligible.

The RHCA doesn’t apply if you travel to Australia for medical treatment.

You may be able to get medical treatment in Australia under the RHCA if you’re travelling to, leaving from, or diverted to Australia, and you needed treatment during your voyage or flight.

If you’re in Australia for a short time and don’t need medical care, there’s no need to enrol.

### If you’re a diplomat

If you’re a diplomat, you and your family are eligible to enrol in Medicare while you’re posted here.

This means the cover under the agreement will apply for as long as you’re in Australia.

### If you’re not eligible for Medicare

If you’re not eligible for Medicare, you can’t claim a benefit for treatment you have in Australia. If you need to lodge an income tax return in Australia, you may be eligible for a Medicare levy exemption. This applies if you weren’t eligible for Medicare for all or part of the financial year. You’ll need to get a [Medicare Entitlement Statement](/medicare-entitlement-statement) from us to do this.

Learn more about the [Medicare levy exemption](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/medicare-and-private-health-insurance/medicare-levy/medicare-levy-exemption) on the Australian Taxation Office website.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers:

-   medically necessary care out of hospital
-   medically necessary care as a public patient in a public hospital including inpatient and outpatient services
-   some PBS prescription medicines at the general rate.

Learn more about the [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) (PBS).

## How to enrol in Medicare

You’ll need to give us copies of your supporting documents. These documents don’t need to get certified. To enrol in Medicare you will need to download and complete the [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). Follow the instructions on the form to enrol.

You need to give us your:

-   current visa
-   Slovenian or non-Slovenian passport.

We also need either your:

-   valid Slovenian Health Insurance Card
-   valid European Health Insurance Card with the initials **SL**

### Extending Medicare eligibility

You can extend you and your family’s Medicare eligibility online if it's about to expire. Learn more about [extending Medicare eligibility](/enrolling-medicare#extendingmedicareeligibility).

## When your cover starts and ends

Your cover starts the day you arrive in Australia.

It ends when the first of these expires:

-   your Slovenian Health Insurance Card
-   your European Health Insurance Card
-   your visa.

If you get medical treatment in Australia before you enrol in Medicare, you might get a Medicare benefit for it.

Once you enrol in Medicare, you should submit your claim. We’ll then be able to tell you if you can get a benefit under the agreement or not.
