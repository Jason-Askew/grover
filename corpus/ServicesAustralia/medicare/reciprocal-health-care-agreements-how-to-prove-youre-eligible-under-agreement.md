# Proving you’re eligible

You’ll need to prove you’re from Australia and eligible for Medicare when you’re in another country.

-   [When you’re in another country](#a1)
-   [When in the Netherlands](#a2)

## When you’re in another country

Ask staff at the hospital or doctor to treat you under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement with Australia.

You’ll need to show both:

-   your Australian passport or another valid passport, which shows you are a permanent Australian resident
-   your current Medicare card.

If your Medicare card is out of date, or will expire while you’re away, call the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone) before you go overseas. You can get a new card before you travel.

## When in the Netherlands

If you’re [travelling to the Netherlands](/reciprocal-health-care-agreement-visiting-netherlands?context=22481) you also need to fill in the [Application form for an A111 Certificate of eligibility](/sites/default/files/documents/application-form-for-an-a111certificate-of-eligibility-netherlands.pdf "PDF document") and post it to:

Zilveren Kruis  
Groep Buitenlands Recht
