# PBS Safety Net Card application

How to apply for a PBS Safety Net card to get cheaper PBS medicines.

When you reach the [threshold](/pbs-safety-net-thresholds?context=22016) you can apply for a PBS Safety Net Card. This card lets you get cheaper medicine for the rest of the year.

To apply, complete the [PBS/RPBS Safety Net prescription record form and application for a Safety Net card form](/pb240). Type your details into page one of the form, then print out both pages. Hand both pages to your pharmacist each time you have a prescription filled. Once you reach the threshold they will give you a card.

Use your PBS Safety Net card whenever you get a prescription filled. It’s valid from the date of issue, for the calendar year. When you show your PBS Safety Net card you’ll get PBS medicine either:

-   for free if you’re a concession card holder
-   for up to $7.70 if you’re a general patient.

When there are 2 or more brands of the same medicine, they may have different prices. If you choose a more expensive brand, it may cost you more.

## If you spend over the threshold before you get a card

If you spend over the threshold before you get a PBS Safety Net card, you may get a refund.

To get a refund complete the [Patient claim for refund Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) form](/pb132).

You can use this form to claim a refund if you either:

-   didn’t show your Medicare card or concession card when you purchased the medicine at the pharmacy
-   spend over your yearly PBS Safety Net threshold.
