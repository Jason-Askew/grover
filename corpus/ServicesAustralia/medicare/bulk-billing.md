## What bulk billing is

Bulk billing means you don’t have to pay for your medical service from a health professional. They bill us instead and they accept the Medicare benefit as full payment for the service. You assign the benefit to them by either:

-   signing a form
-   pressing OK on the EFTPOS terminal after your appointment.

If you have more than 1 service in a visit, you may not be bulk billed for everything.

Not all health professionals bulk bill. You should check if yours does when you make an appointment. To find a health professional who bulk bills, use the [find a health service tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) on the healthdirect website.

You’ll need to pay for your appointment if your health professional doesn’t bulk bill. You may be able to [claim](/medicare-claims?context=60092) some of this money back from us.

You can be bulk billed for a medical service if both:

-   you’re enrolled in Medicare
-   your health professional chooses to bulk bill.

It’s easiest if you bring your Medicare card or number with you when you go to the doctor. Read how to [replace a lost, stolen, or damaged Medicare card](/get-new-medicare-card-if-it-expires-or-lost-stolen-or-damaged?context=60092).

## What bulk billing covers

Bulk billing can cover:

-   visits to GPs and specialists that bulk bill
-   tests and scans like x-rays and pathology tests
-   eye tests performed by optometrists.

If you have a [concession or health care card](/concession-and-health-care-cards), you may be able to get bulk billed services.

### Example

Maya went to her GP to discuss a few health concerns. While she was there, her GP advised her to get a flu vaccination and a blood test to check her iron levels.

Maya’s GP bulk billed her. This means she didn’t have to pay for her appointment.

Maya did have to pay for her flu vaccine. This is because we don’t cover the flu vaccine for most adults. Maya paid a total of $20 to cover the flu vaccine.

Maya asked her GP how much the blood test would cost. Maya didn’t have to pay for this test because the pathology lab that tested the sample chose to bulk bill.
