You’re covered for medically necessary inpatient and outpatient care in a public hospital under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA). Outpatient care doesn’t include visits to a medical practitioner.

You may get medical treatment in Australia under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) if you’re travelling to, leaving from, or diverted to Australia, and you needed treatment during your voyage or flight.

The RHCA doesn’t apply if you travel to Australia for medical treatment.

You don’t need to enrol in Medicare and won’t get a Medicare card.

## Who can get it

To be eligible, you must have been living in Ireland before arriving in Australia.

If you’re here on a student visa, you’re not eligible for Medicare. This means we won't cover any of your medical costs.

### If you're a diplomat

You and your family are eligible to enrol in Medicare while you’re posted here. To enrol in Medicare you’ll need to download and complete the [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). Follow the instructions on the form to enrol.

You’re entitled to full Medicare benefits.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers both:

-   medically necessary care as a public patient including public hospital inpatient and outpatient services
-   some PBS prescription medicines at the general rate.

Your cover is for public inpatient and outpatient hospital care only. You won’t get a Medicare benefit for out of hospital services under the agreement.

## What documents you need to show

At a public hospital or pharmacy, you need to ask staff to treat you under the reciprocal health care agreement.

If you’re a citizen of Ireland, you’ll need to show your Irish passport.

If you’re not a citizen of Ireland, you’ll need to show your:

-   passport
-   valid European Health Insurance Card with the initials IE.

## When your cover starts and ends

Your cover starts the day you arrive in Australia. Your cover ends the day your visa expires.
