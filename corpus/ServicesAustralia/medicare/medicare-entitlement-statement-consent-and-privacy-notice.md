-   _Taxation Administration Act 1953_
-   _Health Insurance Act 1973_
-   _Privacy Act 1988_.

## Medicare Entitlement Statement consent notice

In your online Medicare Entitlement Statement (MES) application, you’re asked to consent to your information being shared with, and collected from, the Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs).

If you consent, we’ll provide the following personal information to Home Affairs:

-   your name
-   your date of birth
-   your travel document details.

This is so Home Affairs can locate your record and verify details relating to your immigration status and records.

If Home Affairs locates your record, they’ll provide us with your:

-   full name
-   passport or ImmiCard number
-   visa details
-   location
-   movement records
-   permanent visa applications and any work rights attached to your visa.

We’ll use this information to assess your entitlement to Medicare. Collecting this information from Home Affairs ensures we have accurate, up to date information when assessing your MES application.

If you don’t consent to us sharing and collecting your information from Home Affairs, you won’t be able to proceed with your online application. Instead, you can apply for a MES using a paper or PDF form. You’ll need to provide copies of your evidence or make a statutory declaration to support your application.
