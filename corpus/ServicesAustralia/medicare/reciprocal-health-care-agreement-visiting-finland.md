# Visiting Finland

The Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) we have with Finland may cover some of your medical costs in the Finnish public health system.

To be eligible it must be essential care that can’t wait till you get home.

You’ll still need to pay a client fee for all treatment in public health care.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers:

-   medical care from health centres
-   nursing care from health centres
-   out-patient care from hospitals, you can go straight there or with a note from a doctor
-   dental care from some centres
-   prescription medicines
-   some travel costs to get medical care, a Kela office can tell you which ones.

## What it doesn’t cover

The agreement doesn’t cover:

-   daily accommodation fees to stay in hospital
-   fees for specialist care or out-patient care.

Your travel insurance may cover these and other extra costs.

## What to do

Be ready to show your passport and Medicare card.
