# Visiting from the Netherlands

If you’re visiting Australia from the Netherlands you may be eligible for medical care under Medicare while you’re here.

## Who can get it

To be eligible for Medicare under the Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA), you must be enrolled in the Netherlands Health Insurance Scheme. This includes citizens and non-citizens of the Netherlands.

If you’re here on a student visa, you’re eligible.

If you’re in Australia for a short time and don’t need medical care, there’s no need to enrol.

### If you’re a diplomat

If you’re a diplomat, you and your family are eligible to enrol in Medicare while you’re posted here.

This means the cover under the agreement will apply for as long as you’re in Australia.

### If you’re not eligible for Medicare

If you’re not eligible for Medicare, you can’t claim a benefit for treatment you have in Australia. If you need to lodge an income tax return in Australia, you may be eligible for a Medicare levy exemption. This applies if you weren’t eligible for Medicare for all or part of the financial year. You’ll need to get a [Medicare Entitlement Statement](/medicare-entitlement-statement) from us to do this.

Learn more about the [Medicare levy exemption](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/medicare-and-private-health-insurance/medicare-levy/medicare-levy-exemption) on the Australian Taxation Office website.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers:

-   medically necessary care out of hospital
-   medically necessary care as a public patient in a public hospital including inpatient and outpatient services
-   some PBS prescription medicines at the general rate.

Learn more about the [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) (PBS).

## How to enrol in Medicare

You’ll need to give us copies of your supporting documents. These documents don’t need to get certified. To enrol in Medicare you will need to download and complete the [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). Follow the instructions on the form to enrol.

### Documents you need to give us if you’re a citizen

You’ll need to show your passport, evidence of your current visa and either:

-   proof you have valid insurance in the Netherlands Health Insurance Scheme
-   your valid European Health Insurance Card with the initials **NL**.

### Documents you need to give us if you’re not a citizen

You’ll need to show your non Dutch passport, your current visa and either:

-   proof you have valid insurance in the Netherlands Health Insurance Scheme
-   your valid European Health Insurance Card with the initials **NL**.

### Extending Medicare eligibility

You can extend you and your family’s Medicare eligibility online if it's about to expire. Learn more about [extending Medicare eligibility](/enrolling-medicare#extendingmedicareeligibility).

## When your cover starts and ends

Your cover starts the day you arrive in Australia. It ends when the first of these expires:

-   your Netherlands health insurance
-   your European Health Insurance Card
-   your visa.

If you get medical treatment in Australia before you enrol in Medicare, you may get a Medicare benefit for it.

Once you enrol, submit your claim. We’ll then be able to tell you if you can get a benefit under the agreement or not.
