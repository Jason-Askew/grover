# Visiting Belgium

The Reciprocal Health Care Agreement (RHCA) we have with Belgium may cover some of your medical costs in the Belgian public health system.

-   [What to do](#a3)

To be eligible it must be essential care that can’t wait till you get home.

You’ll still need to pay some of the costs for each service. Different patient charges apply for all services and treatments.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers:

-   staying in hospital, you’ll pay an admission fee and a small daily fee
-   services received in hospital, you’ll be partially reimbursed for these
-   care from a GP or specialist doctor, you’ll pay 25% to 40% of the cost
-   some dental care if you have a referral from a doctor, you’ll pay 25% to 40% of the cost
-   some allied health services such as physiotherapy if you have a referral from a doctor, you’ll pay 25% to 40% of the cost
-   some prescription medicines
-   50% of the cost of ambulance travel.

## What it doesn’t cover

The agreement doesn’t cover:

-   some pharmaceutical medicines
-   health services and products that aren’t in the benefit package or don’t meet the conditions.

Your travel insurance may cover these and other extra costs.

## What to do

If you’re staying in Belgium for more than 1 year you should register with a Belgian health insurance fund.

You’ll get an e-ID or ISI+ card. You can use this:

-   to claim refunds for health care costs
-   at hospitals and pharmacies to bill costs directly to your fund.

If you’re in Belgium for less than 1 year, or haven’t registered with a Belgian health insurance, you’ll need to:

-   pay for the service at the time
-   take the receipt, passport and your Medicare card to any health insurance fund to claim reimbursement.
