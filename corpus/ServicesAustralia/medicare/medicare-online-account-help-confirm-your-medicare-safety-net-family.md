# Medicare online account help - Confirm your Medicare Safety Net family

Instructions on how to confirm your Medicare Safety Net family using your Medicare online account.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: sign in](#a1)
-   [Step 2: check your family details](#a2)
-   [Step 3: review and submit](#a3)
-   [Step 4: sign out](#a4)

When your Medicare Safety Net family is close to reaching the relevant Safety Net threshold, we’ll ask you to confirm who’s in your family.

You’ll need to do this, so we can pay you higher Medicare benefits for certain services when your family reaches the threshold.

If you’re the family’s contact person or their partner, you can view and confirm your family online.

You’ll need to call the [Medicare program line](/phone-us#medicaregeneral) or complete the [Medicare Safety Net couples registration and amendment form](/ms016) if you:

-   haven’t been asked to confirm your safety net family
-   need to change who’s in your safety net family.

The screenshots and instructions in this guide are for using Medicare online account on a computer or mobile web browser. The screen layout will look different if you’re using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

## Step 1: sign in

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Medicare**.

From your homepage, select **Safety Net** from **Services**.

The Medicare Safety Net page has information about your current and past year Safety Net.

Select the year you want to confirm from the **Medicare Safety Net period for** dropdown menu.

The progress bar shows the amount in gap and out of pocket expenses counted towards the threshold for the year. It only shows expenses up to the threshold amount. It doesn’t show total expenses for the year.

In this example, the verified gap and out of pocket expenses have reached the Safety Net Threshold.

Then select **Confirm your family**.

## Step 2: check your family details

We’ll show who’s in your Medicare Safety Net family.

Review who’s in your family, then select either:

-   **Yes** if you need to change your family details
-   **No** if your family details are correct.

Then select **Next**.

If you need to change who’s in your Medicare Safety Net family, you’ll need to call the [Medicare program line](/phone-us#medicaregeneral) or complete the [Medicare Safety Net couples registration and amendment form](/ms016).

In this example, the family details are correct.

## Step 3: review and submit

We’ll give you a summary of the details you’ve given us. Read the details on this page and make sure they’re correct. If you need to make changes, select **Edit**.

If all the information is correct, read the declaration. If you understand and agree with the declaration, select **Submit**.

If you select Cancel, you’ll still need to confirm who’s in your family. If you don’t, you might miss out on getting higher benefits when your family reaches the threshold.
