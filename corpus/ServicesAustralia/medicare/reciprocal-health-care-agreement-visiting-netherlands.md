To be eligible it must be:

-   essential care that can’t wait till you get home
-   within 12 months after you arrive - in some cases you may be able to extend this.

## What’s covered

The agreement covers hospital care which includes:

-   specialist care
-   nursing
-   prescription medicine, a full or part refund
-   transport, a part refund for ambulance or taxi travel to get urgent care
-   paramedics
-   childbirth.

It also covers care from doctors which includes:

-   psychiatrists, if you’re 18 or older.

## What it doesn’t cover

The agreement doesn’t cover:

-   non-specialist dental care if you’re 18 or older
-   psychiatric care if you’re under 18
-   repatriation costs - costs associated with sending you back to your home country.

Your travel insurance may cover these and other extra costs.

## What to do

### Get a certificate of eligibility

Australians need to apply to the Dutch health insurance company, Zilveren Kruis, to get an A111 Certificate of Eligibility.

You can do this when you arrive in the Netherlands or before you leave home.

To apply online, fill in the [application form](https://www.zilverenkruis.nl/naar-nederland/verzekeringsbewijs-a-111-aanvragen) for an A111 Certificate of Eligibility on the Zilveren Kruis website.

You’ll need a copy of:

-   your current Medicare card
-   your Australian passport or another valid passport.

You’ll need to cover your photo and ID number in the passport copy due to privacy law in the Netherlands.

You’ll also need your resident permit if you need it for your stay in the Netherlands.

If you can’t apply online, fill in the [Application form for an A111 Certificate of Eligibility](/sites/default/files/documents/application-form-for-an-a111certificate-of-eligibility-netherlands.pdf "PDF document") and mail it with your supporting documents to:

Zilveren Kruis  
Groep Buitenlands Recht  
Postbus 650  
7300 AR APELDOORN  
The Netherlands

You can do this when you arrive in the Netherlands or before you leave home.

### To get free emergency medical care

If you go to a doctor, show your A111 certificate and give the doctor a copy of the A111 certificate. You’ll receive emergency care that’s covered under the Dutch basic health insurance. Zilveren Kruis is the health insurance company that usually pays the costs of the medical treatment directly to the health care provider under the RHCA.

### To get a refund for medical care

If you have paid the medical bill yourself and need a refund, submit your claim to Zilveren Kruis.
