# Medicare Safety Nets

Medicare Safety Nets can help to lower your out of pocket medical costs for out of hospital services.

If you need to see a doctor or get tests regularly, you could end up with high medical costs. Medicare Safety Nets can help to lower your out of pocket costs.

These can include:

- seeing a doctor or specialist
- some tests and scans like blood tests and CT scans.

When you spend over a certain amount in a calendar year, we’ll give you a higher amount back. We calculate the Safety Nets each calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.

Keep in mind, your doctor’s visit or test will still cost the same.

If you’re enrolled in Medicare, you’re eligible for Medicare Safety Nets. If you’re part of a family or couple you can combine your costs by [registering as a family](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/how-to-register-for-medicare-safety-nets?context=22001).

If you’re leaving a relationship or living with violence or abuse, there are some things you need to do to [keep your information safe](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship). This includes updating your personal details with Medicare.
