## Claim Medicare benefits at your doctor’s office

The quickest way to claim your Medicare benefit is at your doctor’s office straight after you pay.

To do this you need to both:

-   be [enrolled in Medicare](/enrolling-medicare?context=60092)
-   show your [Medicare card](/medicare-card).

If your doctor bulk bills, you don’t need to pay.

When you pay at the doctor’s office, ask if they can make an electronic claim for you. If they can, they’ll do it on the spot. We’ll process the claim as soon as possible and pay your Medicare benefit into either:

-   the account for the EFTPOS card you used to pay
-   the bank account you’ve registered with us.

You may need to give us proof of payment when you claim. Find out more about [proof of payment](/proof-payment-for-medicare-claim?context=60092).

If we’re paying into your bank account, we need your correct bank account details. Find out how to [update your Medicare details](/how-you-update-your-name-date-birth-or-gender-for-medicare?context=60092).

If you pay using cash, we’ll pay your benefit electronically into the bank account you have registered with us.

## Claim a Medicare benefit for any amount over $10,000

If your claim has an amount that’s $10,000 or more, complete the [Medicare claim form (MS014)](/ms014) and either:

If you submit your claim at a Service Centre, you’ll usually get your benefit within 21 days. We pay electronically into the bank account you have registered with us.

## Claim Medicare benefits for someone else

You can claim for someone else if:

-   they’re enrolled in Medicare
-   you have paid for the service.

You don’t have to be on the same Medicare card as them.

You can claim for someone else by any of the following:

-   at the doctor’s office
-   by mail
-   at a service centre.

You can claim online for someone else if they are on the same Medicare card as you.

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now and select **Make a claim**.

## Track progress of your Medicare claims online

You can track the progress of Medicare claims online that you’ve recently submitted for yourself or someone else on your Medicare card. You can also track claims submitted by your health professional on your behalf, but not bulk bill claims.

You can do this using your Medicare online account through myGov. If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in and select **View recent claims**.

-   **Completed**: We’ve processed your claim. You don’t need to do anything else.

## Adjust a paid claim

If a claim paid to you is wrong, speak to the health professional that submitted it on your behalf.

This could include:

-   incorrect patient details, date of service, charge or provider
-   receiving a cheque in your provider’s name for a service you’ve paid in full.

Your health professional needs to contact us to have the claim adjusted manually.

If you have any questions, contact [Medicare Program](#toolbar-phone).
