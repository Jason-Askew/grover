The screenshots and instructions in this guide are for using your Medicare online account on a computer or mobile web browser. The screen layout will look different if you’re using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

## Step 1: sign in

Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and select **Medicare**.

From your homepage, select **View and edit my details** in **My details**.

Your postal address links to your Medicare card. If you update your postal address online, we’ll update it for everyone on your Medicare card. If your new postal address doesn’t apply to everyone on your card, you need to get a new Medicare card.

In this example we’ll update the postal address for everyone on the Medicare card.

Check if you need to update your residential address, phone numbers, bank details or email address.

The banking details you’ve already told us about will show. To protect your personal information, we’ll only show the last 4 digits of your account number. If you don’t recognise these details, contact us.
