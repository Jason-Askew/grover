# PBS reason codes for Online PBS Authorities

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) processing reason codes for Online PBS Authorities.

When your PBS Authority is processed you may get a reason code in the system you use. These codes may occur if you apply for a PBS authority using the Online PBS Authorities system or your own practice software. There are 4 reason code types:

-   Reject
-   Warning
-   Information
-   Error message.

Contact our [PBS general enquiries](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#pbsgeneral) line for more information.

When prescribing for a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) patient, you’ll need to seek authority from DVA. The process is similar to non-DVA patients. Read more about [prior approval of prescriptions](https://www.dva.gov.au/providers/information-for-gps-other-primary-care-providers/medicines/pharmacy-information-for-providers#prior-approval-of-prescriptions) for Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) patients on the DVA website.
