# Centrelink impersonation email scams

You might get an email claiming to be from Centrelink about urgently updating your details.

The email says your pension, benefit or payment will be suspended, disrupted or changed if you don’t make an update. It tells you to click on a link that will take you to a fake myGov website. The email may also have a link telling you that you need review and sign a digital document.

This is a scam. We won’t send you a link to sign in to your myGov or Centrelink online account or a link to sign a digital document.

The emails may look similar to these:

Scammers want you to feel worried so you’ll act quickly and click on a dodgy link.

Never click on a link in an email or text message to sign in to myGov or your Centrelink online account.

These scam websites will often ask for your:

-   myGov username and password
-   personal details, such as your name, address and date of birth
-   Centrelink Customer Reference Number or Medicare card details
-   banking information, such as your credit card details or BSB and account number.

This is how scammers steal your money and identity.

If you clicked on a link or gave personal information to a scammer, call our [Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk](/phone-us#scams).
