# Getting help

You can get help from an advocate, nominee or us with your Disability Support Pension (DSP).

Watch our video about getting help from an advocate or nominee and how you can have someone to act for you.

[Transcript](/sites/default/files/2025-04/nominee-support-for-disability-support-pension-transcript.docx "Word document") | [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2hspJn4qec)

An advocate can support you while you’re seeking help, claiming a payment from us, and can also attend appointments with you. You can also get help from advocate to help you understand DSP eligibility rules. Help from a government funded advocate service is free.

An advocate is different to having someone act for you as your authorised representative. Read more about what an advocate can do and how you can [find an advocate](/participating-when-youre-living-with-disability#findanadvocate).

You can also read about [Disability Representative Organisations](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-advocacy/disability-representative-organisations) on the Department of Social Services website. Find advocacy services in your area and use the [NDAP advocate finder](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-advocacy/national-disability-advocacy-program#how-to-find-an-ndap-advocate) on the Department of Social Services website.

You can ask someone to act for you with your DSP claim. You can authorise them to speak to us, update your details and get the payment for you.

We can also help you with your DSP claim. If you’re having problems getting evidence, [call us](#toolbar-phone). We can talk with you about your options.
