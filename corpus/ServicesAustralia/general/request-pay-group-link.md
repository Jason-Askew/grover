# Request a pay group link

Pay group links allow providers to direct a Medicare benefit to another payee associated with their practice.

-   [Arrange a pay group link](#a1)
-   [Cancel a pay group link](#a2)

A pay group link allows us to send Medicare benefit cheques to a third person. This person could be a health professional:

-   associated with your practice or practising at another location
-   who works in government-funded organisations.

All providers who work for a government-funded organisation need a pay group link. This is so we can pay Medicare benefits directly to the health care service.

Providers can also use pay group links to:

-   send cheques to a private hospital or a company in private practice where the third person works
-   direct cheques to their company name or to a specific mailing address, for example, a post office box.

Pay group links only apply to cheque payments and only for a particular practice location. Pay group links don’t work with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) payments.

## Arrange a pay group link

To arrange for us to pay benefits to a third party, complete the [request for a pay group link](/hw078?context=20) form.

Both you and the third party must sign the form for either:

-   a new pay group link to pay cheques to a third party
-   a change to a pay group link that involves a third party.

## Cancel a pay group link

You must send us a written request to cancel a pay group link. We’ll let the payee know you’ve cancelled the arrangement.
