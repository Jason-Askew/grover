## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with eculizumab, iptacopan, pegcetacoplan and ravulizumab under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 and section 100 for patients with PNH.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing eculizumab, iptacopan, pegcetacoplan and ravulizumab.

## Section 100 arrangements

### Eculizumab, pegcetacoplan and ravulizumab

These items are only PBS-subsidised for non-admitted patients, day admitted patients, or patients on discharge who are attending:

-   an approved private hospital
-   a public hospital.

These items aren’t PBS-subsidised for public hospital in-patients.

You must include the hospital name and provider number on the authority application form.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with these medicines, patients must be treated by either a:

-   haematologist
-   non-specialist medical practitioner in consultation with a haematologist.

### Complement 5 (C5) inhibitors are defined as eculizumab or ravulizumab

Patients switching from a C5 inhibitor to pegcetacoplan are required to take pegcetacoplan in addition to their current dose of C5 inhibitor for the first 4 weeks of treatment. This minimises the risk of haemolysis occurring when treatment stops abruptly. After 4 weeks, the patient should discontinue treatment with the C5 inhibitor before continuing on monotherapy with pegcetacoplan.

For patients switching from a C5 inhibitor to iptacopan, combination treatment with a C5 inhibitor is not required.
