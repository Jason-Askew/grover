For help with Child Support, you can call the [Child Support Enquiry Line](/phone-us#csgeneralenquiries). Let us know if you need an interpreter and we'll arrange one for free.

## How to manage your child support online

If you have a child support assessment with us, you can manage your child support using our [self service options](/child-support-self-service).

You should create a myGov account and link it to Child Support. Find out more about [how to set up your Child Support online account](/how-to-set-up-your-child-support-online-account).

You can use your Child Support online account through myGov to complete common tasks, including:

-   check when your payments are due and how much you’ll get
-   check how much you owe
-   update your income details.

Find out more about [what you can do with your Child Support online account](/what-you-can-do-with-your-child-support-online-account).

## When circumstances change

You need to tell us when circumstances change for your, your child or the other parent. This is so we can make sure you’re getting the right amount.

This is very important if you collect your child support payments privately from the other parent. Changes to your circumstances may change how much Family Tax Benefit you get.

Your child’s circumstances also affect your support and payments. You need to tell us if any of the following happen:

-   they’re 17 but will still be attending secondary school when they turn 18
-   someone else legally adopts your child
-   they move in with a partner or get married
-   they move overseas.

Depending on their situation, they may also be able to get their own payment.

You can update most of your circumstances online. Find out more about [changes of circumstances that affect child support](/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21901).

If you’re leaving a relationship or living with violence or abuse, there are some things you need to do to [keep your information safe](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship).

## How child support affects family payments

Any child support you receive can affect how much Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A you get. If you collect your child support privately from the other parent, it’s important your child support assessment is accurate. If you’re concerned your assessment may not be accurate, call us on the [Child Support enquiry line](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your options. Find out more about [what happens when we update your child support assessment while you get FTB Part A](/what-happens-if-we-update-your-child-support-assessment-while-you-get-ftb-part?context=21916).

If you’re getting any family payments, you’ll also need to update your details with Centrelink if your circumstances change. You can do this using your Centrelink online account through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) or the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

Learn more about what family payments you may get while your child is [growing up](/growing-up).

## If we need to contact you

Once you have an assessment, we may need to contact you sometimes about your child support.

You can request how and when we contact you. To update your preferences, call us on the [Child Support Enquiry Line](#toolbar-phone).

Sometimes we may need to contact you using a different method or outside your preferred contact times. This may happen if:

-   we haven’t been able to reach you through your preferred method
-   you don’t make payments on time
-   we need to resolve a specific matter.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov you can update your contact details online. This includes your phone number and address.
