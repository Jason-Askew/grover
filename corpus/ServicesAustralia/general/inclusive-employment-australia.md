## How to take part

If you’re getting a payment from us, we may refer you to Inclusive Employment Australia or you can register directly through a provider.

If you’re not getting a payment from us, you can register directly through a provider.

In most cases, you can choose a provider that best suits your needs and change your provider at any time.

We may ask you to attend an [Employment Services Assessment](/employment-services-assessments?context=22276) appointment to assess your work capacity and confirm your eligibility for Inclusive Employment Australia.

## How this program helps you meet your requirements

If you’re a job seeker and have mutual obligation requirements, Inclusive Employment Australia can help you meet your requirements.

If you get Disability Support Pension (DSP) and you’re under 35 you may have [participation requirements](/meeting-participation-requirements-if-youre-under-35?context=22276) to help you prepare for, find and keep suitable work. You can meet these requirements by taking part in Inclusive Employment Australia.

### Program of Support

A Program of Support (POS) helps people with disability to prepare for, find and keep a job.

If you make a claim for DSP, you may need to show you’ve participated in a POS.

Inclusive Employment Australia is one of several suitable POS programs. Read more about [Program of Support](/program-support-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) if you’re claiming DSP.
