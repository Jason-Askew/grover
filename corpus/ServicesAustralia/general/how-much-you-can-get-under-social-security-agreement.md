# How much you can get

You usually get a part pension from each agreement country you live in.

How much you get depends on where you’re living and how long you’ve lived or worked in each country.

If you get an Australian payment, your [income](/income?context=22476) and [assets](/asset-types?context=22476) may affect how much you get.

Read about [pension rates payable to people outside Australia](/payment-schedule-and-rates-for-people-outside-australia?context=22476).

Find information about agreements [in your language](/information-your-language).

Income

Most types of income count in your income test. We use this and your assets test to assess if you can get a payment, and to calculate your rate of payment.
