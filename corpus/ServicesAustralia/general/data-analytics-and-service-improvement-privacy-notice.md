## How we use data analytics on myGov and the myGov app

We deliver myGov on behalf of the Australian Government.

We use Google Analytics 360, Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Customer Journey Analytics on both the:

-   myGov website
-   myGov app.

We collect information about your interactions with the myGov website and myGov app to help us improve our services. This information can’t identify you as an individual.

You can read more about what information we collect and how we handle it at the:

-   [myGov privacy notice](https://my.gov.au/en/about/privacy-and-security/mygov-privacy-notice)
-   myGov app privacy notice on the myGov app.

## How we use Google Analytics on Medicare online accounts

We use Google Analytics to collect details about your use of Medicare online accounts to improve the services we deliver to you. This includes information about:

-   how you navigate to Medicare online accounts
-   the pages you visit
-   your device.

We’ve set up Google Analytics to operate on Medicare online accounts without collecting personal information about you. This means the following information won’t be collected:

-   email address
-   username
-   full IP address.

Additionally, we have disabled settings so that Google cannot use data analytics for its products and services, benchmarking and technical support services.

You can read about how Google Analytics collects and processes data in its privacy notice on the Google website. You can opt out of Google Analytics if you disable or refuse the cookie, disable JavaScript, or [use the opt out service provided by Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## How we use data analytics for our other online services

We collect information about how you use our online services, other than myGov, the myGov app and Medicare online accounts. This includes:

-   Internet Protocol (IP) address
-   browser and operating system, for example whether you use Internet Explorer or Chrome, Windows or iOS
-   screen size and orientation
-   mouse clicks and areas your mouse hovered over
-   fields you’ve entered information into
-   how long it took to do certain tasks
-   how you move through pages.

We collect this information to help us improve the services we deliver.

We use this information to:

-   find out when our systems aren’t working as expected
-   understand user needs and what’s hard to use on our online services and applications
-   learn where we can streamline services
-   cater for different types of browsers and devices you use
-   develop relevant help information
-   improve our ability to assist people who call us for help.

Authorised staff can playback your interactions. We use this information to learn how you use our digital channels.

We know a session is yours if you either:

-   tell us about it during a phone call
-   sign in to your online account.

Your information stays confidential. We don’t give it to anyone unless they’re an authorised staff member or it’s required by law.

We remove information that might identify an individual before it’s stored.

We destroy information in accordance with Australian law. We destroy:

-   replayable website interactions after 7 days
-   data such as clicks and searches after 30 days
-   summary reports on event data after 500 days.

We may use your personal information with automated decision-making systems and tools to help us provide you with the services, and undertake the activities, described in this privacy notice. If we use these systems and tools, we will comply with all applicable laws when doing so. Our use of these systems and tools does not affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.
