# Understanding your FTB balancing outcome

Once we’ve balanced your Family Tax Benefit (FTB), we’ll let you know the outcome in writing.

## on this page

-   [If you get top ups and supplements](#topupsandsupplements)
-   [If you get an overpayment or have existing debts](#outstandingdebts)
-   [If you need to pay back money you owe](#paybackmoneyyouowe)

Your FTB balancing outcome will be one of the following:

-   a top up including supplements, where we owe you money
-   a debt, where you need to pay money back
-   no change, where you got the right amount of FTB.

## If you get top ups and supplements

If we didn’t pay you enough FTB during the financial year, you may get a top up. When we balance your FTB, we’ll also check if you’re eligible for any of the following:

-   [FTB Part A supplement](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151#ftbpartasupplement) of up to $916.15 for each eligible child
-   [FTB Part B supplement](/family-tax-benefit-part-b-payment-rates?context=22151#ftbpartbsupplement) of up to $448.95 per family
-   [Single Income Family Supplement](/single-income-family-supplement) of up to $300 per family.

We’ll pay any top ups and supplements you’re eligible for directly to you. We’ll do this after we’ve checked for any debts you might have with the Australian Government. For example, a debt you may have with us or the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

## If you get an overpayment or have existing debts

If we paid you too much FTB during the financial year, you may get a debt. We call this an overpayment.

We can recover any new overpayments, or other existing Centrelink debts you have from any of the following:

-   future FTB payments, including arrears
-   FTB supplements and top-ups
-   your tax refunds.

We call this debt offsetting and use it to reduce the amount you owe. We can recover your debts from these payments even if you have a repayment arrangement with us.

We won’t recover existing debts if repayments are paused due to a disaster or an emergency event, or a pending formal review. Find out more about when you can [pause your debt repayments](/when-you-can-pause-your-debt-repayments).

If we recover your debt from your tax refund, it’s important to know this offsetting process is different to the [tax refund garnishee process](/if-you-dont-take-action-to-repay-centrelink-debt#taxrefundgarnishee).

If you receive child support and your assessment changes, this can impact your balancing outcome and you may get an FTB debt. Read more about [how child support can affect FTB balancing](/family-tax-benefit-part-balancing-and-child-support?context=21911)

### ATO debt recovery

If you have an outstanding debt with the ATO, they may recover it from any of the following:

-   your FTB top up and supplements
-   your FTB lump sum claim payments.

Read more about [how we recover debts at tax time](/how-we-recover-debts-tax-time).

If we use your tax refund to recover your overpayment or existing debt, it will show as a credit offset to Centrelink on either your:

-   Notice of Assessment
-   statement of account from the ATO.

Read more about what you can do to [set yourself up for next financial year](/helping-you-get-right-outcome-tax-time) and avoid an overpayment.

## If you need to pay back money you owe

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can check your Centrelink debts online. To do this, [sign into myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services) and select **Money you owe**.

You can change or [pause your debt repayments](/disaster-events-where-you-have-flexible-debt-repayment-choices) if you’re affected by a current disaster event in your state or territory.

If you disagree with a decision we’ve made, you have the right to ask us to review it. Read more about [reviews and appeals](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).

It’s important you talk to us if you’re experiencing financial hardship or worried about paying back a debt. We can work with you to set up a repayment plan you can afford.
