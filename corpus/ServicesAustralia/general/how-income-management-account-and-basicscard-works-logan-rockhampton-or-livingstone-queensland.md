# How it works

Income Management in Logan, Rockhampton or Livingstone, Queensland helps you manage your payments for essentials like food, rent and bills for you and your family.

You don’t get less money, but you do get it differently.

Part of your payment goes to an Income Management account and the rest goes into your regular bank account.

You can’t use your income managed money to buy any of the following:

-   alcoholic products
-   tobacco products
-   pornography
-   gambling products and services
-   homebrew kits or concentrates.

You can spend the rest of your money how you like.
