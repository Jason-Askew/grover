For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

Depending on your circumstances, you may get Disability Support Pension (DSP) while you’re outside Australia.

## If you leave within 2 years of returning to Australia to live

Your DSP may stop if you:

-   came back to Australia to live
-   started getting DSP after you returned to Australia
-   travel outside Australia during the next 2 years after you returned.

Your payment may continue if you travel to a country we have a [social security agreement](/international-social-security-agreements) with.

No other DSP travel rules will apply.

## Leaving Australia to live in another country

If you leave Australia to live in another country, your DSP will stop when you depart. This is unless one of these applies:

-   you’re terminally ill and returning to your country of origin, or to be with or near a family member
-   you left Australia before 1 July 2004, we advised we’d pay you indefinitely and you haven’t returned to live in Australia
-   you had a travel-specific medical assessment before leaving and you meet the [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   you had a travel-specific medical assessment before leaving and at the assessment we confirmed that an appropriately qualified medical professional has diagnosed you with a permanent and severe disability that stops you from working
-   you move to a country we have a [social security agreement](/international-social-security-agreements) with and you can get DSP under that agreement.

In these situations you’ll keep getting DSP while you’re outside Australia, though the amount you get may change.

## Leaving Australia temporarily

If you leave Australia temporarily you may continue getting DSP. This will depend on your circumstances.

### When you can get DSP for up to a total of 28 days

You can get DSP for up to a total of 28 days while travelling overseas in a 12 month period if your travel is temporary. It doesn’t matter if you make a single trip or multiple trips. It’s a total of 28 days for all of your overseas travel in a rolling 12 month period, not 28 days per trip. The day you leave Australia counts as a day of travel. The day you return to Australia doesn’t count as a day of travel. It doesn’t matter what time of the day you return.

#### Example of a single trip

Barbara gets DSP and has not travelled overseas for many years. On 5 September 2023 she goes on a holiday to France for 8 weeks. Barbara is paid DSP for the first 28 days of her holiday and then her payment stops. If Barbara has another overseas holiday before 5 September 2024 she will not get paid DSP as she does not have any days of payment for overseas travel left.

#### Example of multiple trips

Cathy gets DSP and has never travelled overseas. On 3 March 2023 she goes on a holiday to Fiji for 10 days. Cathy is paid DSP for the 10 days of her holiday. On 21 August 2023 she goes on a 4 week holiday to the Philippines. She is paid for the first 18 days of her travel and then her DSP stops as she has no days of payment for overseas travel left. If Cathy has another overseas holiday before 3 March 2024 she will not get paid DSP as she does not have any days of payment for overseas travel available. From 3 March 2024 she will have 10 days of payment for overseas travel available. From 21 August 2024 she will have another 18 days of payment for overseas travel available.

### When you may get DSP for more than 28 days

You may get DSP for more than 28 days in a 12 month period if any of the following apply:

-   you’re studying outside Australia as part of a [full time Australian course](/approved-courses-and-education-providers)
-   you’re severely disabled and depend on, and live with, a family member posted outside Australia temporarily for work
-   you had a travel-specific medical assessment before leaving and you meet the [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   you had a travel-specific medical assessment before leaving and at the assessment we confirmed that an appropriately qualified medical professional has diagnosed you with a permanent and severe disability that stops you from working
-   you go to a country we have a [social security agreement](/international-social-security-agreements) with and you can get DSP under that agreement.

You may also get DSP if you travel for an approved reason. If granted, you’ll get your payment for the time required to deal with the reason. This will generally be 2-3 weeks. The maximum period is 28 days per trip. This is separate to your 28 days of travel in a 12 month period.

The approved reasons are:

-   to attend an acute family crisis - for example to visit a [family member](/residence-descriptions?context=22276#familymember) who’s critically ill
-   for specific humanitarian reasons - for example to adopt a child or attend custody proceedings
-   to get eligible medical treatment that isn’t available in Australia
-   to take part in the Paralympic Games, including qualification or preparation events in the 12 months before the Paralympic Games.

### Evidence we need

You must provide detailed evidence that supports the reason for travel. The evidence you need to provide depends on the circumstances.

Evidence may include any of the following:

-   a death certificate for the family member
-   a medical certificate from an overseas hospital
-   a statement from police
-   a court order
-   a letter from your treating doctor
-   a letter confirming your participation in a Paralympic qualification event
-   other documents relating to the reason for travel.

If you don’t give us the evidence before you leave Australia, your payment may stop when you depart. If we’ve stopped your payment, we’ll reassess it once we get your evidence.

You can upload your evidence using your Centrelink online account through myGov.

### If you can’t return to Australia due to unforeseen circumstances

We may be able to extend your payment of DSP overseas if certain unforeseen circumstances occur. Contact us if all of the following apply:

-   you’re temporarily overseas
-   your DSP is about to reduce or stop
-   you can’t return to Australia due to unforeseen circumstances - this includes a serious illness or natural disaster.

You must provide detailed evidence that supports the reason you can’t return to Australia. The evidence you need to provide depends on the circumstances. You can upload your evidence using your Centrelink online account through myGov.

If you have a [Pensioner Concession Card](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-pensioner-concession-card), it will cancel after you’ve been temporarily overseas for 6 weeks.

## Travelling to a country with an international social security agreement

You may get DSP overseas if all of these apply:

-   you go to a country we have a [social security agreement](/international-social-security-agreements) with
-   the agreement covers DSP
-   you’re severely disabled
-   you meet all the rules under the agreement.

The amount you’ll get under the agreement may be different to your current DSP rate.
