# Claiming again

Before claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP) again, you should check you meet the eligibility rules.

If you claim DSP again, we may reject your claim unless:

-   your circumstances have changed
-   you have new medical evidence that shows your condition has changed.

## Claiming again if your circumstances have changed

If you submit a new claim for DSP, we’ll assess if you’re eligible based on all of the following:

-   your current circumstances
-   any previous assessments of your medical evidence and conditions
-   any new evidence you submit with your claim
-   the new Impairment Tables that started 1 April 2023.

Read more about the [Impairment Tables](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers-benefits-payments/impairment-tables-for-disability-support-pension) on the Department of Social Services (DSS) website. They also have an easy read guide that you can download or listen to.

You can also read about the latest [review of the DSP Impairment Tables](https://www.dss.gov.au/help-and-support-disability/review-disability-support-pension-impairment-tables) and see a summary of the [changes](https://www.dss.gov.au/income-support-payments/resource/table-changes-impairment-tables).

We understand your condition may have changed since you last claimed. You need to provide new [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) if you claim again.

### Program of Support

A [Program of Support](/program-support-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) (POS) can help you to prepare for, find and keep a job. You may need to participate in a POS before you claim DSP.

To show you’ve now participated in a Program of Support (POS), you may need to give us all of the following:

-   details of your participation
-   details of the provider
-   any evidence you have from your provider about your participation.

We may also contact your provider to discuss your participation.

You also need to read [who can get it](/who-can-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and [how we assess you](/how-we-assess-your-claim-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) for DSP. This will help you prepare before you submit a new claim.
