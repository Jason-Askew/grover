# Decide how to claim

There are a few options for claiming Age Pension. Before you start you should decide how you want to claim.

## on this page

-   [Online](#a1)
-   [Paper form](#a2)
-   [Staff assisted](#a3)

## Online

You can claim Age Pension online from the comfort of your home using your computer or mobile device. You can also claim online at a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) using our computers.

Our online system is safe and secure. You can complete your claim in your own time. If you need to take a break, your Centrelink online account saves your claim so you can come back to finish it later.

Claiming online can save you time as you won’t be asked questions that don’t apply to you. You can review your answers and claim progress at any time. If both you and your partner want to claim, you can submit a combined claim online. To use this option, both of you need to:

-   have your own myGov accounts linked to your own Centrelink online accounts
-   have your own mobile number and have access to [electronic messaging](/electronic-messaging)
-   show as a couple in the My Details - My Profile section of your online accounts
-   both be Age Pension age or turning Age Pension age in the next 13 weeks.

The combined claim option won’t show if you’re in a [crisis](/crisis-and-other-help) situation.

To make sure it is a combined claim you will have to tick the combined claim check box. For combined claims, one partner can complete the claim form in their online account. The other partner will then have tasks to complete in their online account before the claim can be submitted:

1.  Follow the steps to submit a combined claim online - one partner should begin the claim in their online account.
2.  They must check the box for combined claim.
3.  The other partner should then complete their tasks in their own online account.
4.  The claim can then be submitted by either partner.

To claim online, your Centrelink online account needs to be linked to myGov. If you don’t have these, learn how to [create them](/create-online-account).

If you already have a Centrelink online account linked to myGov, you can sign in now and start your claim.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

Before you submit your claim, check to make sure you have provided all the supporting documents. We won’t be able to assess your claim until these are uploaded. Find out how you can [upload](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online) your [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-age-pension?context=22526) online.

## Paper form

If you can’t claim online, you can use the Claim for Age Pension and Pension Bonus form. When you’re [ready to claim](/how-to-claim-age-pension?context=22526#getreadytoclaim), print and complete the [Age Pension claim form](/sa002) and the [Income and Assets form](/sa369).

Don’t forget to include the [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-age-pension?context=22526) and forms we ask for when you submit your claim.

The claim form has details about how to submit your paper claim.
