# Fixed and minimum assessments

We can base some child support assessments on a fixed rate or a minimum rate.

## on this page

-   [Fixed rate](#a1)
-   [Minimum rate](#a2)
-   [If you receive income support from us and owe child support](#a3)

## Fixed rate

Fixed rate assessments set an amount you need to pay in a year.

### Who it’s for

This rate is for paying parents who meet all of the following. They:

-   have a low adjusted taxable income for the last relevant year
-   didn’t receive an income support payment in the last relevant year
-   don’t have at least [shared care](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-child-support-payments?context=21911#sharedcare) of the child.

### How much you pay

The fixed rate for [child support periods](/child-support-assessment-period?context=21911) starting on or after 1 January 2026 is $1,825 per child per year.

If you pay the fixed rate for more than 3 children, we’ll cap the amount at 3 times the fixed rate.

If you pay the fixed rate to more than one person, we divide the amount between those receiving parents.

### If you can’t pay the fixed rate

You can ask us not to use the fixed rate if you can show both of the following:

-   your current income from all sources is genuinely low
-   it would be unfair to expect you to pay the fixed rate.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to apply.

If you can’t access myGov, use the [Application for fixed annual rate not to be used form](/cs4119).

## Minimum rate

A paying parent must usually pay at least the minimum rate of child support.

### Who it’s for

You may pay this rate if both of the following apply:

-   your child support assessment works out to less than the minimum rate
-   you don’t have at least [regular care](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-child-support-payments?context=21911#regularcare) of any of the children in the child support case.

The minimum rate for [child support periods](/child-support-assessment-period?context=21911) starting on or after 1 January 2026 is $551 per year.

### If you earn less than the minimum rate

You can ask us to reduce your payments to $0.

Apply using the [Application to reduce minimum assessment to nil form](/cs2840).

### If you have 2 or more cases

You’ll pay the minimum rate for each child support case.

If you pay the minimum rate for more than 3 families, you’ll pay 3 times the minimum rate.

### If you pay the minimum rate and your income goes up

In some circumstances you may stay on the same rate for up to 28 days.

After that we use your new income in the assessment.

## If you receive income support from us and owe child support

We can take up to three times the minimum rate out of your income support payment. We can keep doing this as long as you have child support to pay us.

Call us on the [Child Support Enquiry line](#toolbar-phone) to talk about what you can do about these deductions.

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Child Support enquiry line

Use this line if you have a question about child support or need to report a change in your circumstances. Let us know if you need an interpreter and we’ll arrange one for free.
