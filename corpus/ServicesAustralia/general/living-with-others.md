-   [In a relationship](#a1)
-   [If you separate](#a2)
-   [Shared housing](#a3)
-   [What to do if you have safety concerns](#a4)

You may be living with any of the following:

-   housemates
-   your partner
-   ex-partner
-   family member(s).

If you’re getting a payment from us and living with other people, we need to know. Living with others can affect the payments and services you get from us.

## In a relationship

If you’re in a relationship, you need to tell us within 14 days.

Your partner’s income and assets can affect how much we pay you and what services you can get. When you have a partner, your income and assets may also affect any payments or services they can get.

Read about [getting together](/getting-together-for-relationship-changes) with a partner and how to tell us.

## If you separate

If you separate from your partner, it can affect your payments. You need to tell us within 14 days so we can pay you the right amount.

Read about [breaking up](/breaking-up-with-your-partner) and support for [separated parents](/separated-parents).

## Shared housing

### Living with someone who’s not your partner

Living with someone you’re not in a relationship with can still affect your payment. For example the amount of [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) you may get. This will depend on who you’re sharing with, and how you’re contributing to household costs.

You can let us know who you’re living with when you [change your address](/changing-your-address-if-youre-moving-house?context=60023).

You can also update your details with the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

### When you’re single and share accommodation

You may need to complete and return the [Relationship details form](/ss284) if:

-   you’re single
-   you share accommodation with anyone who’s not an immediate family member or other family member
-   the person you’re sharing with is 16 years or over.

Immediate family includes:

-   parents (including step-parents)
-   legal guardians
-   siblings (including step-siblings)
-   children (including adopted, fostered and step-children)
-   grandparents
-   grandchildren.

Other family members include:

-   aunties
-   uncles
-   cousins
-   in-laws.

If you have to complete a Relationship Details form, the person you share with will also need to complete and return the [Relationship details form](/ss284). They don’t need to do this if it puts your safety at risk.

If you have safety concerns, please tell us on the form.

### If you’re separated under one roof

If you share accommodation with your ex-partner, you and your ex-partner will need to complete and return the [Relationship details - Separated under one roof form](/ss293). Your ex-partner won’t need to complete the form if it puts your safety at risk.

We’ll need to regularly review your living arrangements. This is so we pay you the right amount.

## What to do if you have safety concerns

If you have concerns about your safety, we may be able to help. We can help you if there’s a [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence) situation. Talk to us if you’re in, have left, or are preparing to leave this relationship.

We take your privacy seriously. Whether you are leaving a relationship or living with abuse or violence, you should learn how you can [keep your information safe](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship).
