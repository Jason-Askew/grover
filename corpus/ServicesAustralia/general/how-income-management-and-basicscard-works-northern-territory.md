# How it works

Income Management in the Northern Territory helps you manage your payments for essentials like food, rent and bills.

You don’t get less money, but you do get it differently.

Part of your payment goes to an Income Management account and the rest goes into your regular bank account.

You cannot use your income managed money to buy any of the following:

-   alcoholic products
-   tobacco products
-   pornography
-   gambling products and services
-   homebrew kits or concentrates.

You can spend the rest of your money how you like.

About Income Management and BasicsCard

Income Management is where we split your Centrelink payment for you before you get it. Some goes to your Income Management account and the rest goes into your normal bank account.
