# Meeting the income test

To get Parental Leave Pay, you must meet an income test.

## on this page

-   [How the income test works](#a1)
-   [Examples of meeting the income test](#a2)

We use your adjusted taxable income to work out your eligibility for Parental Leave Pay. If you don’t meet the individual income test, you may meet the family income test.

## How the income test works

We’ll look at your income from the financial year before either:

-   the date of birth or adoption
-   the date you lodge your claim.

We’ll use whichever date is earlier.

To get Parental Leave Pay, you must have an individual [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=64479) of either:

-   $180,007 or less in the 2024-25 financial year
-   $175,788 or less in the 2023-24 financial year.

If you don’t meet the individual income test, you can use a family income test. You can get Parental Leave Pay if your and your partner’s [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=64479) is either:

-   $373,094 or less in the 2024-25 financial year
-   $364,350 or less in the 2023-24 financial year.

Your partner is the person you’re in a relationship with on the date you claim. If you don’t have a partner, this limit will apply to just your income.

## Examples of meeting the income test

Partnered person meeting the family income test

Reema has a baby on 2 July 2025 and lodges a claim for Parental Leave Pay. Her income in the 2024-25 financial year was $215,000. This is over the individual income limit of $180,007. Reema’s partner Mohammed’s income was $90,000 in the 2024-25 financial year. Their combined income is $305,000 in the 2024-25 financial year. This is below the family income limit of $373,094. Reema meets the family income test for Parental Leave Pay.

Partnered person meeting the individual income test

Ashley and Dom adopt a child on 9 August 2025. Dom lodges a claim for Parental Leave Pay. Dom’s income in the 2024-25 financial year was $160,000. Ashley’s income in 2024-25 financial year was $225,000. Dom is under the individual income limit of $180,007 so meets the income test for Parental Leave Pay. Ashley’s income is over the individual income limit. Dom and Ashley’s combined income of $385,000 is also over the family income limit of $373,094. Ashley doesn’t meet the individual or family income test for Parental Leave Pay. Only Dom can get Parental Leave Pay.
