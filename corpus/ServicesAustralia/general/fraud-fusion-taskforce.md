## About the Taskforce

The Fraud Fusion Taskforce is a group of agencies working to stop fraud and criminal activity, including serious and organised crime.

The taskforce aims to:

-   work better together to find and prevent fraud
-   make government payment systems stronger to reduce fraud
-   build skills and knowledge among government staff to keep programs and payments safe.

Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) jointly lead this taskforce.

24 government agencies participate in the taskforce, including:

-   the [National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission](https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/)
-   the [Australian Federal Police](https://www.afp.gov.au/)
-   the [Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission](https://www.acic.gov.au/).

The Fraud Fusion Taskforce started in November 2022.

## Transition from Taskforce Integrity

Taskforce Integrity was a partnership between Services Australia and the Australian Federal Police to tackle serious fraud and identity crime. It officially joined the Fraud Fusion Taskforce from 1 July 2023.
