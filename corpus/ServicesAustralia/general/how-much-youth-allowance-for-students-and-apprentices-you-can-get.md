# How much you can get

We use income and assets tests to work out how much Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices you can get. These are the maximum rates.

Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices who are 16 or older is a taxable Centrelink payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=43916).

## Payment rates

We update these payment rates on 1 January each year.

The table is a guide only.

When you apply for a payment you and your partner need to provide income and assets details. This affects how much you can get. If you’re dependent, the parental means test applies. If your parents or guardians earn too much, you won’t be able to get a payment.

Use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to find out how much you could get. It will be an estimate only and depends on you entering accurate information. You’ll need to enter your partner’s or your parents’ or guardians’ income along with other details. This includes your income details.

If you’re younger than 18 and dependent, your parent or guardian will usually get the payment, to help you manage it.

## Other rates

We use different rates for Youth Allowance if either of the following apply:

-   you’ve been getting another income support payment long term before starting Austudy
-   English isn’t your first language and you’re studying an English language course.

This table shows the higher rate of Youth Allowance for current students or apprenticeships.

The table is a guide only.

### When you’ve been on long term income support

As a student, you need to meet all the following to get the long term income support rate:

-   be at least 22 years old
-   not have a dependent child
-   have a full-time or concessional study load
-   get an income support payment that isn’t a student or apprentice payment
-   have been getting this other payment for at least 26 of the last 39 weeks before starting your course of study
-   begin your course after you turn 22 years old.

If you were receiving Jobseeker Payment immediately before starting your course of study, you will only qualify for Youth Allowance if your course lasts for at least 12 months.

As an Australian Apprentice you need to meet all the following to get this rate:

-   not have a dependent child
-   get an income support payment, that isn’t a student or apprentice payment
-   have been getting this other payment for at least 26 of the last 39 weeks before starting your apprenticeship
-   start your apprenticeship after you turn 22.

If you change your course or apprenticeship, you’ll keep getting this rate if both of the following apply:

-   you don’t have a break in qualifying study or apprenticeship
-   you continue to meet [progress and allowable time rules](/allowable-time-for-study-while-getting-youth-allowance?context=43916).

We don’t consider it a break in qualifying study if you complete semester 1 in one course and continue studies in a new course in semester 2. If you change from one apprenticeship to another and your commonwealth registration number remains current, this is also not a break.

### When you’re studying an English language course

The different rates for Youth Allowance may also apply if you meet all the following:

-   you’re 22 or older
-   you don’t have a dependent child
-   English is not your first language
-   you’re studying an English language course.

## Payment reviews

Sometimes we review your payment.

The amount you get may change if your circumstances change or a family member’s [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-while-getting-youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916).

If you’re a dependant, we’ll ask for details of your [parents’ or guardians’ taxable income](/annual-parental-income-reassessment?context=43916) in September or October each year.

If you’re a student, we’ll ask for details about your future study intentions. We’ll ask you 4 weeks before your course finishes.
