In some situations, you can choose to get Carer Payment or Age Pension.

-   [What each payment is for](#a2)
-   [How they are similar](#a3)
-   [How they are different](#a4)
-   [If the person you care for dies](#a5)

## Who can choose

You can choose to get [Carer Payment](/carer-payment) or [Age Pension](/age-pension) if both of these apply to you:

-   you’re over [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension)
-   you’re providing care for someone with a disability or medical condition.

## What each payment is for

[Carer Payment](/carer-payment) is an income support payment you can get if you provide constant care to someone who:

-   has a severe disability or medical condition
-   is an adult who is frail aged.

The term frail aged means an older Australian who’s in need of a substantial level of care and support.

[Age Pension](/age-pension) gives you income support and access to a range of concessions. There are other [payments, concessions and support](/age-pension-payments-concessions-and-support) if you get Age Pension.

Just before you reach Age Pension age, we’ll invite you to transfer to Age Pension. You’ll need to tell us if you:

-   want to transfer to Age Pension or stay on Carer Payment
-   have any superannuation.

## How they are similar

Some ways Carer Payment and Age Pension are similar include:

-   the rate of payment depends on your circumstances
-   both payments use the income and assets tests for pensions
-   you can get a [Pensioner Concession Card](/pensioner-concession-card)
-   [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) rates are the same, except if you’re single and share privately rented accommodation.

Both are also taxable. Carer Payment is only taxable when the carer or the care receiver reaches Age Pension age.

## How they are different

There are different rules for Carer Payment and Age Pension.

### Income and assets tests for the care receiver

There are different rules about income and assets tests for the care receiver when you get Carer Payment or Age Pension.

If you get Carer Payment

If you get Age Pension

We assess the income and assets of the care receiver. We’ll do this if they’re not already getting income support from us or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.

Doesn’t apply.

### Reviews

There are different rules about reviews when you get Carer Payment or Age Pension.

If you get Carer Payment

If you get Age Pension

We may review your and your care receiver’s circumstances. This is to confirm the care receiver’s needs and the care you are providing still qualify you for Carer Payment.

If you get Age Pension and Carer Allowance, we may review your circumstances. We may also check that you still provide daily care and attention. This helps us confirm that you still qualify for Carer Allowance.

### Travelling outside Australia

There are different rules about travelling outside Australia when you get Carer Payment or Age Pension.

If you get Carer Payment

If you get Age Pension

If you travel temporarily outside Australia without the person you provide care for, we can pay Carer Payment. We can pay you for up to 6 weeks if you have [respite days](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-payment) available.

If you travel temporarily outside Australia with the person you provide care for, we can pay Carer Payment. We can pay you for the first 6 weeks. In some circumstances, we can pay Carer Payment for longer than 6 weeks.

If you or the person you provide care for stop living in Australia, your Carer Payment will stop on departure. It won’t stop if you qualify under an international social security agreement.
