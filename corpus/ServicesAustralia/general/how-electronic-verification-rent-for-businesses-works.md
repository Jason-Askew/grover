# How it works

Electronic Verification of Rent (EVoR) helps you manage your tenants’ rent details. It saves their time and yours.

EVoR is secure and free to use.

By using EVoR, you make sure your tenants are able to get the right amount of [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) from us. This can stop your tenants falling behind on their rent.

EVoR lets you tell us about rent changes in advance. You also won’t have to sign a Rent Certificate for a tenant whenever their rent changes.

## When to tell us about rent updates

You must update your tenants’ rent details between 15 and 50 days before the rent changes when using EVoR. This ensures that both:

-   the customer gets the right rate of Rent Assistance
-   you don’t create a Centrelink debt for the customer.

You may also consider applying to use [Centrepay](/centrepay-for-businesses) to receive rent payments from tenants.

## What EVoR can’t do

You can’t use EVoR to start Rent Assistance. Before you can use EVoR, a customer must have given us verification of the rent they pay you and be getting Rent Assistance.

You can then use EVoR to update and verify future changes to your tenants’ rent amount.
