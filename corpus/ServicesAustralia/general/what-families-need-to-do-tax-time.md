# What families need to do at tax time

You can use our tax time tool if you got Family Tax Benefit (FTB), Child Care Subsidy (CCS) or had a child support assessment in the last financial year.

The financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. We balance your FTB after the financial year ends and you get your last payment. We balance CCS payments from mid August.

If you got FTB or CCS you need to confirm your family income for us to balance your payment. If you had a partner during this time, they’ll need to do this as well.

At the end of each financial year, we’ll compare your income estimate with your actual income. This is how we check you got the right amount. This is called balancing. Most families need to do something before we can balance their [FTB](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=60007) or [CCS](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-child-care-subsidy?context=60007).

Most parents who have a child support assessment need to lodge a tax return.

Answer yes if you chose to get your FTB fortnightly, including if you chose zero rate as your payment option. If you chose this option you won’t have got any FTB throughout the financial year. This is different to claiming as a lump sum.
