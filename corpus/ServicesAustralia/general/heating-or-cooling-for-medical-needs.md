# Heating or cooling for medical needs

You can get the Essential Medical Equipment Payment (EMEP) for heating or cooling used for medical needs.

This is if you experience any of these conditions:

-   a stroke
-   a brain injury
-   a neurodegenerative disorder
-   muscular dystrophies
-   full thickness burns on more than 20% of your body
-   rare sweating disorders including congenital absence or mal-development of sweat glands
-   chronic erythrodermas.

You may also get the payment if you use [eligible equipment](/eligible-equipment-for-essential-medical-equipment-payment?context=21831) in your home.
