# Education and training providers

Information for education and training providers to support students getting ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance or Assistance for Isolated Children.

We have payments and services to help students with the cost of studying.

As an education and training provider, you play a role in helping students learn about and keep these payments. You may also need to claim some payments on their behalf, like ABSTUDY.
