## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with biological medicines under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 and section 100 for adult patients with severe Crohn’s disease.

Where the term **biological medicine** appears it refers to:

-   adalimumab
-   infliximab
-   upadacitinib
-   ustekinumab
-   vedolizumab.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing biological medicines.

These items aren’t PBS-subsidised for public hospital in-patients. You must include the hospital name and provider number on the authority application form.

## Treatment specifics
