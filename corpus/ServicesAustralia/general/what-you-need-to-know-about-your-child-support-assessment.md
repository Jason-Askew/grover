# What you need to know

How a child support assessment works.

[

The assessment period

A child support period is the amount of time an assessment covers. It can be up to 15 months.

Parenting plans

A parenting plan is a written agreement with the other parent. It sets rules for things like how much time the children will spend with each parent.

Ending an assessment

There are a number of reasons why a child support assessment will end.

Non-parent carer

If you provide care for a child and aren’t the parent, you may be able to receive child support from both parents. You must apply for a child support assessment.
