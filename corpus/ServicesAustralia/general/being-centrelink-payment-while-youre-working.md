For some Centrelink payments, there are things you need to do before we can pay you for the first time. For others, there are things you need to do to keep getting your payment. Check what you need to do.

## When it’s your first time getting a payment

Once we’ve approved your claim, we’ll send you a letter to tell you when your payment will start. We’ll also tell you if there’s anything you need to do to keep getting your payment.

If you get an income support payment, you need to report your and your partner’s income, even if it’s zero, before we can pay you for the first time. This is so we can check we’re paying you the right amount.

If you don’t let us know by the due date, your claim may be cancelled. Be sure to check the letter we sent you.

Depending on your circumstances and the type of income support payment you’re claiming, you may need to do the following before your payment can start:

-   attend an appointment with an employment services provider, if you’re referred to one
-   agree to a Job Plan, if you’re referred to Workforce Australia online.

Check if you’re getting an [income support payment](/income-support-payment).

You can check your regular payment amount using your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) or [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

## How to keep getting your payment

If you get certain payments from us, you may need to do some tasks and activities to keep getting your payment. We call these mutual obligation or participation requirements. These may include having a Job Plan or Participation Plan.

The tasks and activities you need to do depends on the payment you get. If you don’t meet your requirements, it can affect your payment.

Find out [what your mutual obligations are](/mutual-obligation-requirements) for your payment.

If you get Disability Support Pension (DSP), there are different [things you must do to keep getting DSP](/what-your-commitments-are-for-disability-support-pension-dsp).

## What to do if your details or circumstances change

If your details or circumstances change, you need to tell us within 14 days of the change. If you have a partner, you need to tell us about their changes too.

These include changes to your or your partner’s:

-   address
-   phone number
-   work details
-   income or assets
-   study details
-   relationship status.

If your circumstances change, you’ll also need to let your employment services provider know, if you’re connected to one.

If you don’t let us know, you may get a debt that you’ll need to pay back. Or, you may miss out on extra support we can give you.

You have to [report any employment income](/employment-income-reporting) you or your partner have been paid, even if it’s zero, and any other changes to your circumstances every fortnight before we can pay you. You can find your reporting dates in your Centrelink online account.

You can check your payment to find out [what changes you need to tell us about](/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment).

## How to fix a mistake

If you’ve made a mistake with something you’ve told us, tell us as soon as you can. If you don’t, we might pay you too much and you’ll need to pay us back. Or, we might pay you too little.

Most people can update their details online using their [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) or [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you can’t or you made the mistake more than 12 weeks ago, you’ll need to [phone us on your regular payment line](/phone-us) so we can help you fix it.

## How we contact you

We may get in touch with you by sending a letter to your address or myGov Inbox. You’ll get an SMS or email when you have a new letter in your myGov Inbox.

You can do this using your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) or [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

## When we need extra information from you

Sometimes, we may need extra information from you. If we do, we’ll send you a letter to tell you what you need to give us, by when, and the easiest way to do so.

## What happens if there’s a change to your payment

If your payment is reduced, suspended, cancelled or changed, you’ll be notified.
