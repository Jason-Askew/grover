# If you don't work

If you don’t work you still accrue a bonus.

If you don’t work, you still accrue $300 to your Work Bonus balance each fortnight.

The maximum Work Bonus balance limit you can accrue is $11,800.

You may get a $4,000 credit to your Work Bonus balance when you claim if you’re eligible and haven’t already received one.

Work Bonus isn’t money you can draw on to use for other things. But you can benefit from it to help you keep more of your pension if you’re working.
