# Access Medicare Easyclaim

Patients can claim their Medicare benefit and have it paid into their bank account through your practice’s EFTPOS terminal.

Medicare Easyclaim is used for Medicare bulk billing and patient claiming.

It can be a stand-alone process via an EFTPOS device or an integrated feature of your practice management software products. If you’re using it for patient claims, you can start lodging claims for your patients once your EFTPOS provider installs it. For bulk billing, you’ll need to register your bank account details first.

Medicare Easyclaim is simple to adopt and requires minimal training. You can use it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Your patients will get their benefit almost immediately after swiping their EFTPOS card.
