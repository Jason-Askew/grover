## Help to decide what to do after school

If you aren’t sure what to do next, there’s information to help you decide.

You can:

-   use the [Jobs and Skills Atlas](https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au/jobs-and-skills-atlas) for insights into the Australian labour market at national, state, and regional level
-   go to the [myfuture](https://www.myfuture.edu.au/) website to discover your strengths, and make career decisions
-   use the [Your Career](https://www.yourcareer.gov.au/learn-and-train/courses) website to compare training at different providers.

## Help to prepare for your next steps

To help transition to life after school, you can:

-   get a [tax file number](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/tax-file-number) (TFN) using the Australian Taxation Office website, if you don’t already have one

## Help to continue study

We have payments to support you if you’re considering further study, including either:

You can also use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what payments you might be eligible for. It can also tell you out how much you could get each fortnight. It will be an estimate only and depends on you entering accurate information.
