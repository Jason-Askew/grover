# Transition to Work participation requirements

There are a number of recognised participation types that count towards your requirements. These include studying, looking for a job, working or training.

## on this page

-   [Studying](#a1)
-   [Looking for a job](#a2)
-   [Working](#a3)
-   [Training](#a4)

You’ll need to give us evidence of the recognised participation you’re doing. Read more about [providing support documents](/applying-for-additional-child-care-subsidy-transition-to-work?context=41866).

## Studying

To meet the study requirements, you must be:

-   doing at least one approved course of education or study
-   making satisfactory progress to complete the course.

### Approved course of education or study

Your level of study must be either:

-   a higher level than you’ve completed in the last 10 years
-   the same level as a course you started but didn’t complete in the last 10 years and haven’t used all the subsidy for.

This doesn’t apply if your course qualifies you for a job on the Occupation Shortage List. You can find out more about the [Occupational Shortage List](https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au/data/skills-priority-list) on the Department of Jobs and Skills website.

If you already get a payment from us as a student, your study requirements will be the same.

You can’t get transition to work subsidy if you’re studying either:

-   certificate I
-   masters
-   any type of doctorate.

How long you can get transition to work subsidy for depends on your [level of study](/transition-to-work-additional-child-care-subsidy-amount?context=41866) and whether you’re studying full time or part time.

#### Example of doing an approved course of education or study

Grace has a Certificate IV that she completed 5 years ago. This means she can get the transition to work subsidy to study at the Diploma level or above. To get it for a lower level, it must help her work toward a job on the Skills Shortage List. In this case, a lower level of study would be a Certificate IV or lower.

### Satisfactory progress to complete the course

You must be attending the course and meeting the minimum requirements of the course. You’ll need to give us evidence of your progress, if requested.

#### Example of not making satisfactory progress

Alex has been doing an approved course. However, he fails his first semester subjects. Because of this, he can’t do the second semester subjects. This means Alex doesn’t meet the minimum requirements. He’ll need to let us know he’s not making satisfactory progress.

## Looking for a job

To meet job search requirements, you must be actively looking for work. This can include any of the following:

-   looking for job vacancies
-   preparing resumes and applying for jobs
-   contacting potential employers
-   preparing for and attending job interviews.

## Working

To meet the work requirements, you must be participating in one of the following:

-   doing paid work
-   doing unpaid work including work experience or an internship
-   doing volunteer work
-   doing unpaid work in a family business
-   actively setting up a business.

## Training

To meet the training requirements, you must be doing either:

-   a vocational training course
-   another program which improves your job prospects.

Other programs could include government funded rehabilitation or a literacy and numeracy program.
