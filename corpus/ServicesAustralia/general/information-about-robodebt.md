# Information about Robodebt

The Income Compliance Program, known as Robodebt, ended in November 2019. We’ve refunded people who paid money back on robodebts.

If you didn’t pay any money towards your robodebt, we reduced it to zero. This means it no longer exists.

A small number of former customers still need to update their details with us so we can pay their refund. Read about [how to check if you’re owed a refund](/robodebt-refunds?context=60271#howtocheck).

## What are robodebts

Robodebts are debts that were raised between July 2015 and November 2019 under the Income Compliance Program. They were raised using averaged Australian Taxation Office (ATO) income information.

Most Centrelink debts aren’t robodebts. This is because they weren’t raised using averaged ATO income information and don’t relate to the Income Compliance Program.

Debts related to the annual [balancing of family assistance payments](/balancing-your-family-assistance-payments), such as Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Subsidy, were not part of robodebt.

We stopped raising debts using averaged ATO income information as the only evidence from November 2019.

All debts raised after November 2019 use other income information to verify a debt.

## What debts you need to repay

You still need to repay Centrelink debts you have that were raised using other income information.

If you have a [Centrelink debt](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments?context=60271), we’ll let you know when you need to make a payment. We’ll also let you know [how to set up a payment arrangement](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink?context=60271) if you can’t pay by the due date. Most people choose to pay the money back over time.

## If you want more information or don’t agree with a decision we’ve made

You can contact us and ask us to explain our decision or apply for a formal review.
