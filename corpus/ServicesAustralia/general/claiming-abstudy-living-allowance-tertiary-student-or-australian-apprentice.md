## When tertiary students need to claim

You can claim up to 13 weeks before you start your course. If you’re studying a course for:

-   30 weeks or more, you must complete and submit your claim before 31 December in that year
-   less than 30 weeks, you’ll need to submit your claim before the last day of your course.

## When Australian Apprentices need to claim

You can claim up to 13 weeks before you start your Australian Apprenticeship. You must complete and submit your claim by the start date of your apprenticeship. If you submit your claim after your apprenticeship starts, we will still accept it. However, we may only pay you from the date you submitted your claim.

If a medical condition or special circumstances stop you from doing so, call us on our [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).

## Steps to claim ABSTUDY Living Allowance as a tertiary student or Australian Apprentice

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.

    You’ll need a Customer Reference Number (CRN) to link your Centrelink online account to myGov.
    
    If you ever got a payment from us you’ll still have a CRN, CRNs don’t change.
    
    If you don’t have a CRN, you’ll need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=45541) online through myGov to get one.
    
    If you can’t get a CRN online, you can call us on the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=45541) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim
