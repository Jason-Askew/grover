## How to tell us

You can tell us about changes in your circumstances by calling the [Disability, sickness and carers](/phone-us#peoplewithdisability) line or by visiting a [service centre](/find-us).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can tell us about some changes by signing in and selecting **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

## What happens if you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about these changes, we may pay you too much. If this happens you’ll have to pay the money back.

If you deliberately don’t tell us when your circumstances change, you could be [committing fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud?context=21816).

## What you can do when you reach Age Pension age

If you’re getting Carer Payment and reach Age Pension age, you can transfer to [Age Pension](/age-pension).
