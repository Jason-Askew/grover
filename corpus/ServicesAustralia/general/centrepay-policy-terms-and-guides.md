## Centrepay notice of variation

On 28 August 2025 a decision was made to reform Centrepay.

Variations have been made to the current Centrepay Policy and Terms (version 3.0) and Centrepay Procedural Guide for Business (version 6.0) to implement this decision.

We amended both the current Centrepay Policy and Terms (version 3.0) and the current Centrepay Procedural Guide for Business (version 6.0) so that they read as set out in the new Centrepay Terms of Use and the new Centrepay Policy for Businesses.

These variations came into effect on 3 November 2025.

You can read these documents on [Centrepay Terms of Use and Policy](#touandpolicy) below.

These variations are made in line with clause 7.1 of the Centrepay Policy and Terms (version 3.0) (see page 23).

In line with clause 7.3 of the Centrepay Policy and Terms (version 3.0), you are taken to agree to these variations if you use Centrepay after 3 November 2025. This includes:

-   lodging, varying, suspending or cancelling a deduction authority or
-   receiving Centrepay payments and not returning it within 10 business days.

If you don’t agree with, or can’t comply with, these variations, you can voluntarily withdraw from Centrepay by emailing [centrelink.business.support@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:centrelink.business.support@servicesaustralia.gov.au), giving at least 20 business days' notice.

Notice published on 3 September 2025.

## Centrepay Terms of Use and Policy from 3 November 2025

You must use both the new Centrepay Terms of Use and the Centrepay Policy for Businesses.

Read them together to understand the Centrepay bill paying service and your business obligations.

### Centrepay Policy for Businesses

The [Centrepay Policy for Businesses](/sites/default/files/2025-07/centrepay-policy-for-businesses.docx "Word document") gives businesses and organisations information about Centrepay and what they need to do to get payments through Centrepay.

The Policy also explains how to apply for Centrepay and how to use Centrepay.
