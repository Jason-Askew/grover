# Exemptions to the limits of days

You need to tell us if you have an exemption to the limits on Parental Leave Pay days.

You can [share your Parental Leave Pay](/sharing-your-parental-leave-pay?context=64479) with your partner or another parent. There is a limit on how many days you can take at the same time.

If you have a partner, some days are reserved for them to use. There is a limit on the number of days reserved for your partner, which depends on your child’s date of birth or adoption.

There are some exemptions to these limits.

Exemptions to the limit for taking days at the same time
