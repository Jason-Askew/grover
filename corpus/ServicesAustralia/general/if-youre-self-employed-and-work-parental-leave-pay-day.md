# If you’re self-employed and work on a Parental Leave Pay day

If you're self-employed, you must not work on any day you choose to get Parental Leave Pay.

When you get Parental Leave Pay, you won’t be able to work on any day you choose to get this payment. This includes actively running your business or daily operations.

You also can’t spend more than one hour doing occasional tasks, such as any of the following:

-   paying an account
-   checking on the delivery of an order
-   approving the business accounts
-   dealing with ad hoc disputes
-   organising a repair
-   organising replacement staff to manage your absence
-   maintaining a basic level of contact with clients
-   keeping your professional skills up to date.
