# About waiting periods

You may have to wait a period of time to get Farm Household Allowance (FHA).

How long you have to wait will depend on your circumstances.

The time you spend waiting doesn’t count as part of the 4 years you can get FHA.

[Liquid assets](/liquid-assets-waiting-period) and [ordinary waiting periods](/ordinary-waiting-period) don’t apply to FHA claims.

Other [waiting periods](/waiting-periods) may apply.
