## Access to documents

We make a range of documents available for public access. You can formally request access under the _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (FOI Act) to documents we hold. Alternately, we can give you certain information if you request it through other access arrangements we have set up. They’re outlined below.

### Release of your own information

You can ask to see or get a copy of any personal information we hold about you. We can provide copies of some documents without the need for special requests. For instance, we can provide a copy of any of these:

-   the application forms and other documents you submitted to us
-   copies of letters already sent to you, such as decision letters
-   your payment history information.

#### Use online accounts

You can view, update and request some information, including personal information we hold about you, immediately through your online account. This is a secure way for you to access some of your information.

Read more about [Personal Information releases](/personal-information-releases?context=64107) for details and forms.

### Your rights

The _Freedom of Information Act 1982_ (FOI Act) gives any person the right to do all of the following:

-   access copies of documents we hold, except exempt documents
-   ask for us to change or annotate your information if it is incomplete, out of date, incorrect or misleading
-   seek a review of our decision to deny you access to a document or not to amend your personal record.

You can ask to see any document that we hold. We can refuse access to some documents, or parts of documents that are exempt. Exempt documents may include:

-   those relating to national security
-   documents containing material obtained in confidence
-   Cabinet documents

![](/sites/default/files/2025-12/ips.png)

As required by the FOI Act, we have an [Information Publication Scheme](/information-publication-scheme?context=64107) entry that provides information on all of the following. Our:

-   structure
-   functions
-   appointments
-   annual reports
-   consultation arrangements
-   information we routinely release following FOI requests
-   information we routinely provide to Parliament.

### FOI disclosure log

![](/sites/default/files/2025-12/foi-disclosure-log.png)

Our [FOI disclosure log](/freedom-information-disclosure-log?context=64107) lists information we have released since 1 May 2011 in response to requests made under the FOI Act.

## Types of requests

### Requests for data

Access [Statistical information and data](/statistical-information-and-data) that is publicly available.

There are also options to seek high level statistical data outside of FOI. For more information and guidance on these processes, email [statistics@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:statistics@servicesaustralia.gov.au). Before sending an email you should check if the information is available through [statistical information and data](/statistical-information-and-data).

Data requests are assessed on an individual basis and a fee may apply.

There may be requirements to seek clearance from other sources including other government departments to meet your request for data.

### Media requests

Media should use Services Australia’s Media Team as a first point of contact for information and data requests. Read more about the [Media Section](/media) or email [media@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:media@servicesaustralia.gov.au).

### Freedom of information requests

We have processes in place to provide you with your personal information without the need for a Freedom of Information request, where this is appropriate to do so.

If you complete the [FOI application form](/si031) you will be asked if you would like documents released through these processes instead of the FOI Act, where it is appropriate to do so.

If you are seeking access to documents that contain your personal information, we will require proof of your identity before the release of any personal information.

### Someone else making a request for you

You can ask someone else to make a request for you.

If you ask someone to make an FOI request on your behalf, you need to provide a specific, written authority for us to send copies of documents about you to that person, or to allow that person to inspect copies of documents containing information about you.

You can provide an authority for another person to have access to your information by signing the relevant section of the FOI Application form.

## How to make an FOI request

Submit your request by completing the [Freedom of Information - Request to access or change documents form](/si031).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can submit the completed form online. You can also submit by post, email or at one of our offices.

Your request must:

-   be in writing
-   state that the request is an application for the purposes of the FOI Act
-   provide information about the documents to help us process your request
-   provide an address for reply.

If you’re seeking access to documents that contain personal information, you’ll need to provide proof of identity first by completing the identity questions.

If a document contains information about a third party, we may need to consult them and extend the time to give you our decision by another 30 days to allow us to do so. We may also seek your agreement to extend the time by up to 30 days if your request is complex.

## If you disagree with our decision

When we have made a decision about your FOI request, we will send you a letter explaining our decision and your review and appeal rights.

A third party who disagrees with our decision to give you documents that contain information about them can also ask for our decision to be reviewed.

We will advise you of our new decision within 30 days of receiving your request. Please send requests for internal reviews to the appropriate agency, FOI contact details as listed above.

### Information Commissioner review

You can ask the Australian Information Commissioner to review our original decision or our decision on internal review within 60 days of the date of decision or 30 days after you are notified if you are an affected third party.

Read more on the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/) website.

### Complaints

If you do not agree with the way we have handled your request, you can complain to the Australian Information Commissioner who may investigate our actions. More information is available on the [OAIC](https://www.oaic.gov.au/) website. The Commonwealth Ombudsman can also investigate complaints about our actions. However, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner will consult to avoid the same matter being investigated twice.
