This information applies to care periods before 1 November 2025.

On 1 November 2025, Support at Home replaced the Home Care Packages Program. Find out more about the [Support at Home program](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/support-at-home) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

You need to tell us when a care recipient leaves your care, so you’re paid correctly.

You can tell us about departures in the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

You’ll need an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to [access the ACPP](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

## Checking home care account closure date

Any monthly entitlement will accrue in a home care account for each recipient.

Following a care recipient’s departure, services will have access to the care recipient’s home care account for 70 days to claim any outstanding invoice amounts.

After 70 days, the home care account will no longer be available to that service.

To check the home care account closure date, select the **care recipient profile** and:

1.  In the **Commonwealth amount** tab, select the **Home care account** menu item to open the **Home care account balance** screen.
2.  In the **Home care account balance** screen, you’ll see the home care account balance, care recipient’s departure date and the closure date for the home care account.

## Submitting an outstanding invoice amount

You’re able to submit an outstanding invoice amount within 70 days of your care recipient’s departure.

To submit an outstanding invoice amount, select the **care recipient profile** and:

1.  In the **Commonwealth amount** tab, select **Invoice amount**.
2.  Select **Register invoice amount**.
3.  Enter the invoice amount for the claim month and select **Submit**.
4.  If you’ve successfully filled in all the relevant information, you’ll see a **Successful receipt** screen.

## Returning provider-held Commonwealth unspent amount

This event is for care recipients who entered your care before 1 September 2021. You’re able to return provider-held Commonwealth unspent amount within 70 days of your care recipient’s departure.

If you need to make changes beyond 70 days, refer to [making changes outside of the 70-day period](#70dayperiod).

To report the provider-held Commonwealth unspent amount that needs to be returned, select the **care recipient profile** and:

1.  In the **Commonwealth amount** tab, select the **Commonwealth unspent amount on departure** menu item to open the **Commonwealth unspent amount on departure summary** screen.
2.  Select **Register Commonwealth unspent amount on departure**.
3.  On the **Register Commonwealth unspent amount on departure** screen, enter the Commonwealth unspent amount for the care recipient.
4.  Check the details and select **Submit**.
5.  If you’ve successfully filled in all the relevant information, you’ll see a **Successful receipt** screen.

## Making changes outside of the 70-day period

You can make changes outside of the 70-day period to:

-   adjust invoicing or unspent funds
-   update a care recipient’s entry, leave or departure event.

To make changes, you’ll need to upload documents in the ACPP stating the reason for the request. You’ll also need evidence to adjust the amounts associated with the cost of the care recipient.

To upload documents outside of the 70-day period, select the **care recipient profile** and:

1.  From the **Care recipient menu** select **Care recipient evidence summary.**
2.  Select **Upload Evidence.**
3.  Then select **Invoicing and unspent fund update** or **70-day update.**
4.  **Upload** the documents stating the reason for the request.
5.  **Upload** the relevant supporting evidence to adjust the amounts associated with the cost of care for the care recipient.

We’ll review the request once your request is submitted.

The request is considered incomplete if illegible, unclear or missing required information and documents.
