# Add someone to a Medicare card

You can update your card when your circumstances change.

## on this page

-   [Add someone 15 or older to your Medicare card](##adding)
-   [Add children under 15 to an existing Medicare card](#a2)
-   [Add your baby to a Medicare card](#a3)
-   [Add someone to a Medicare card using a form](#useaform)

If there’s a change in your family situation, it’s important to also check your Medicare Safety Net registration.

Learn more about [how to manage your Medicare Safety Net](/how-to-manage-your-medicare-safety-net).

## Add someone 15 or older to your Medicare card

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to add someone 15 or older to your Medicare card.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also do this by:

-   using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   completing the [Application to copy or transfer from one Medicare card to another form](/ms011).

Find out [how to invite someone to your card](/manage-invites-to-your-medicare-card-online?context=21796).

## Add children under 15 to an existing Medicare card

If you’re a parent or guardian, you can add a child to an existing card. This can be your current card or someone else’s card.

If the child is not on your current family card, you’ll need to give us some supporting documents, for example:

-   Family Court Order
-   Birth Certificate showing parental responsibility.

To add a child under 15 to an existing card, you’ll need to complete a [form](#useaform).

## Add your baby to a Medicare card

We’ll add your baby to your Medicare card once they’re enrolled in Medicare.

You should [enrol your baby in Medicare](/enrolling-your-baby-medicare) as soon as possible. You can do this using the Newborn Child Declaration you get from the hospital.

When you enrol your baby, we’ll send you a new Medicare card with their name on it. You can get a digital copy of your Medicare card with your baby’s name straight away through the myGov app. Find out how to [get a digital card](/how-to-access-your-digital-medicare-card?context=21796).

## Add someone to a Medicare card using a form

If you can’t request to add someone to your existing card online, you can use a form. Follow these steps to apply:

1.  Complete an [application to copy or transfer from one Medicare card to another form](/ms011).
2.  List all the people you want add on your new card.
3.  Send your form and supporting documents to us.

You can find the email and postal address on the form.
