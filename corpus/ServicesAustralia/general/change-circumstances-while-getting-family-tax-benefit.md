# Change of circumstances

You need to tell us when your circumstances change when you get Family Tax Benefit.

## on this page

-   [What to tell us](#a1)
-   [How to tell us](#a2)

## What to tell us

You need to tell us if any of the following things change:

-   [your name](#changename)
-   your address
-   the amount of rent you pay
-   your or your partner’s [family income](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=22151)
-   your child starts or stops full time secondary study from the day they turn 16
-   you or your child are [leaving the country](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22151), temporarily or to live somewhere else
-   you or your partner don’t have to lodge a tax return.

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in to tell us about most changes to your circumstances.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option, please call the [families line](#toolbar-phone).

There are some changes you can’t tell us using a self service option. You need to call the [families line](#toolbar-phone) to tell us about changes to the following things:

-   your [relationship changes](/relationship-changes), for example if you become partnered or separated
-   your child’s [care arrangements](/changing-your-childs-care-arrangements?context=22151) - the amount of time a child is in your care changes or your child leaves your care
-   your child dies
-   your child is in a prison or juvenile justice centre as a result of a court order
-   your child is [leaving the country](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22151), temporarily or to live somewhere else alone.

### Changing or correcting your name

It’s important to tell us if you [change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink).

## When to tell us

You need to tell us about a change in your circumstances as soon as possible to reduce the risk of an overpayment. If you don’t, we may pay you too much and you may have to [pay back the money](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink).

If you deliberately don’t tell us when your circumstances change, you could be [committing fraud](/report-fraud). Read more about [how to avoid committing fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Centrelink families line

[136 150](tel:136150)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 8 pm

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income. We may have sent your child a letter asking for this in September or October, read how you can [update your income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
