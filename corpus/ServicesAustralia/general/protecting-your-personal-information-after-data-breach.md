## Where to find advice about large data breaches

You can find specific information and support relating to the [Medisecure cyberattack](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/cyber-security/cyber-coordinator/medisecure-cyber-security-incident) on the Home Affairs website.

## What can happen if your information is exposed in a data breach

It’s important to monitor your personal accounts for unusual activity after a data breach. If your personal information is exposed it can lead to identity theft and fraud. Scammers and cyber criminals may use stolen personal information from data breaches to:

-   gain access to your online accounts
-   target you with scams to get more information or money
-   pretend to be you online or in the community.

Scammers target people in any way they can, including:

-   emails
-   text messages
-   social media messages
-   phone calls.

This can have serious consequences, including financial loss and emotional harm. Read more about how we can [help if a scam or identity theft has affected you](/help-if-scam-or-identity-theft-has-affected-you?context=60271).
