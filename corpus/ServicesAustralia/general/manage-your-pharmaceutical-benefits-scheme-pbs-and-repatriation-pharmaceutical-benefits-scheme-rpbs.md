# Manage your PBS and RPBS stationery order

When to expect your Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) or Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) stationery order, track your order and fix order errors.

Use your Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) account to manage your PBS or RPBS stationery.

## When to expect your stationery

Our dispatch timeframes depend on the type of stationery you order. This will usually be between 4 to 7 days. Personalised stationery will take a little longer.

Some stationery can take a little longer. This includes the following:

-   authority pad
-   dental practitioner
-   optometrist
-   nurse practitioner.

Once we dispatch your order, Australia Post will deliver it.

How to track your order

When you order through HPOS, you’ll see your tracking number on the **Your orders** screen once we dispatch your order. You can use this number to track your order on the [Australia Post website](https://auspost.com.au/mypost/track/).

[Log in to Provider Digital Access (PRODA) to access HPOS](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1).

How to fix errors when ordering online

When ordering online, you may see an error message asking you to contact the system administrator. This means your Pharmacy Approval Number or Hospital Provider Number might not be linked to HPOS for PBS services.

If this occurs, you’ll need to:

1.  Log in to PRODA to access your HPOS account.
2.  Select **Link identifiers** on the **HPOS** tile.
3.  Select your pharmacy organisation.
4.  Add **Pharmacy Approval Number** or **Hospital Provider Number** as a new identifier for HPOS.

A Pharmacy Approval Number or Hospital Provider Number may already have been added for the PBS Online service but must be added for HPOS.

You’ll need to access HPOS as either an individual or organisation. If you choose the incorrect role, the PBS Stationery Online Ordering tile may not appear. You can read more about [managing members and delegations in an organisation](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda) in PRODA.

Your organisation may need to [add and link to HPOS for PBS](/adding-and-linking-to-hpos-for-pbs).
