To add someone 15 or older to your card online, for example your partner, you’ll need to invite them to your card. Then they’ll need to accept your invite.

## Invite someone to your card

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to invite someone to your card.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also use the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

You can do this if you meet all the following:

-   you’re 15 or older
-   you’re living in Australia and you’re an Australian citizen, a New Zealand citizen or you have a permanent resident visa
-   your name on your current Medicare card has less than 25 characters
-   someone else doesn’t act on your behalf for Medicare purposes
-   you’re not in the care of a state or territory child protection authority.

You can invite someone if they meet all the following:

-   they’re 15 or older
-   they’re living in Australia and are an Australian citizen, a New Zealand citizen or have a permanent resident visa
-   they’re only on one Medicare card
-   their name on their current Medicare card has less than 25 characters
-   someone else doesn’t act on their behalf for Medicare purposes
-   they’re not in the care of a state or territory child protection authority.

If this isn’t your situation, you’ll need to complete a [form](/ms011) and mail it to us or email [Medicare Enrolment Services](/write-to-us#medicare).

## How to invite someone

You’ll need to create an invite code and give it to the person you want to add to your card.

To create an invite code, you’ll need their:

-   Medicare card number
-   Individual Reference Number (IRN) - the number next to a person’s name on a Medicare card
-   full name as shown on the Medicare card
-   date of birth
-   consent to give their information online.

We’ll let you know if your invite has been accepted. We’ll send 2 new Medicare cards to the address you’ve given us.
