# Medical intern application for provider or prescriber number

As a medical intern you may be able to apply for a Medicare provider number or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriber number.

You need a Medicare provider number to refer or request services that are eligible for a Medicare benefit.

Medical interns who trained in Australia or New Zealand may be able to apply online for a Medicare provider number.

When you apply for your provider number, you can also apply for a Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme ([PBS) prescriber number](/apply-for-initial-provider-and-prescriber-numbers?context=20). You’ll need this to prescribe PBS medicines.

You’ll need to create a [Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account](/provider-digital-access-proda). You can do this any time, even before you get your provisional registration.

When you have your provisional registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) you need to link your PRODA account to Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). HPOS is an online portal for health professionals to do business securely with government services.

When you get provisional registration with the Medical Board of Australia, Ahpra will send us your details.

Within one day of your provisional registration effective date, we’ll send an email telling you can apply for a provider number if you:

If we’ve asked you for supporting documents, we’ll need to review your application. This means you may not get your provider number straight away.
