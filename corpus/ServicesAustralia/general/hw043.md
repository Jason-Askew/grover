Use this form to add or amend the record of a Contracted Service Provider (CSP) organisation within the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service.

How to use our forms

Download and complete the [HI Service - application to amend details of a contracted service provider organisation record form](/sites/default/files/2024-12/hw043-2412en-f.pdf "PDF document").

You must ensure that the amendments made to a CSP organisation details do not deem the CSP organisation ineligible for ongoing use of a CSP registration number under the _Healthcare Identifiers Act 2010_.
