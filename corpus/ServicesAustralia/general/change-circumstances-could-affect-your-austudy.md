## Tell us within 14 days

You need to tell us about any changes to your circumstances within 14 days. This includes changes to your dependent child and partner’s circumstances.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us about changes to your circumstances online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also tell us using either:

-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [Centrelink phone self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option please call the  [youth and students line](#toolbar-phone).

If you don’t tell us, it may affect your payment. You may need to pay back money we’ve paid you. If you’re dishonest in order to get a payment, you are committing fraud. Read more about [how to avoid committing fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud).

It’s important you tell us about any changes. Here are some examples.

## Study

Tell us if any of these things happen:

-   you don’t stay enrolled in your course
-   you stop studying and don’t plan to return to study
-   you stop being a full time Australian Apprentice
-   you don’t start your course within 2 weeks of the course start date
-   you change your course
-   you start studying at a different institution
-   you reduce your study or training workload
-   you are no longer getting a STARTUP-HELP loan for your Startup Year course.

## Employment and income

Tell us if any of these things happen:

-   you start or stop work
-   you change your work hours or change jobs
-   you get compensation, leave or redundancy payments
-   you [start or stop getting a scholarship (bursary, stipend or grant)](/income-from-scholarships-for-students-and-apprentices?context=43916)
-   you change your income or assets
-   you get income from outside Australia
-   you start or stop getting other financial help to complete your course or apprenticeship
-   you change your bank details, including opening or closing a bank account
-   you have a change to you or your partner’s income or financial assets of more than $2,000
-   you buy or sell a car, house or other assets.

### What a nil rate payment period is

You enter a nil rate payment period when you report employment income and if both apply:

-   your Income Bank credit balance is zero
-   your maximum income before your payment reduces to $0 is reached.

You can have up to 12 fortnights in a row of $0 payment before we’ll suspend or cancel your payment.

Your total income includes:

-   your income
-   your partner’s income
-   your combined income.

If we pay you at least $1 before the end of the 12 fortnights, we won’t suspend or cancel your payment.

You must continue to report your income fortnightly to us so we can apply the nil rate payment period. If you have a partner, this applies to their income as well.

We’ll automatically restart your payments if the total income reported is both:

-   below the maximum income before your payment reduces to $0
-   within the nil rate payment period.

You won’t need to submit a new claim or serve any waiting periods.

If you’re getting a supplementary benefit or hold a concession card, these won’t be affected in a nil rate payment period.

To learn more about how your income affects your payment, read about the [income tests for Austudy](/income-tests-for-austudy?context=22441).

You can find more information on [Income Bank](/income-bank).

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.
