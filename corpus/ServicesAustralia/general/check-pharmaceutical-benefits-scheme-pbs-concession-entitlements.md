# Check PBS concession entitlements

Help with Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) concession rates, invalid concession cards and checking the PBS threshold.

-   [Help when you can’t charge the PBS concessional rate](#a1)
-   [Invalid cards](#a2)

Your patient must have a valid concessional entitlement to get the lower Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) concessional rate.

## Help when you can’t charge the PBS concessional rate

There may be times when your patient can’t get the concessional rate. This may be because your patient’s concessional entitlement isn’t valid.

Check the patient’s entitlement status is valid before dispensing medicine.

## Invalid cards

Your patient’s card may be invalid if:

-   it’s expired
-   they’ve changed their name
-   their Centrelink payment stopped
-   caring arrangements changed
-   income has changed
-   living arrangements or their partner’s living arrangements have changed
-   they’ve returned from overseas and haven’t told Centrelink.

When a card is invalid, the patient will need to contact the card issuer.
