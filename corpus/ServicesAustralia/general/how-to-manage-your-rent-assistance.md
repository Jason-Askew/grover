# How to manage your payment

There are things you need to tell us if you get Rent Assistance.

## on this page

-   [If your circumstances change](#a1)
-   [If you’re in-between home addresses](#a2)
-   [Updating your details online](#a3)
-   [Help in a crisis](#a4)

If you already get a payment from us, we’ll automatically check if you can get Rent Assistance when you tell us about changes to any of these:

-   your address
-   your accommodation type
-   the amount of rent you pay
-   who you live with.

## If your circumstances change

To keep getting Rent Assistance you need to tell us if:

-   you change your address or contact details
-   your accommodation details change
-   the amount of rent you pay changes
-   you plan to travel outside Australia.

You can tell us up to 14 days before the change.

You may need to give us proof of your rent arrangements. Find out more about [verifying your rent details](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-rent-assistance?context=22206#verification).

You can ask us for a review of your Rent Assistance at any time.

## If you’re in-between home addresses

If you get a payment from us, it’s important to tell us if either:

-   your address or rent details will change in the next 14 days
-   you’re in-between home addresses.

We can only send your mail to your new address from the date you have told us you’ll be living there. Make sure you keep us up to date and tell us where to send your mail in the meantime.

While you’re waiting to move, it’s important you give us a secure mailing address. If you don’t, your mail will go to the last mailing address you gave us.

Find out how to keep us up to date when you [change address](/changing-your-address-if-youre-moving-house).

We have information and support available if you’re moving because of [changes to your relationship](/relationship-changes).

## Updating your details online

You can tell us up to 14 days before these details change. We have a guide on how to [update your address, accommodation and contact details](/centrelink-online-account-help-update-address-accommodation-and-contact-details).

## Help in a crisis

If you’re experiencing [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence), we can help you with information, resources and referrals. We can also help you get your mail securely.
