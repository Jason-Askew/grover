# What to bring to your assessment

You’ll need to bring some paperwork to your assessment. You can also bring someone for support.

You’ll need to bring some information to your Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) appointment. This includes:

-   identification, for example your driver licence’s or Australian Passport
-   aids, equipment or assistive technology you use, such as hearing or visual aids.

You don’t need to bring information you’ve already provided to us for your claim or review.

If you have new [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you haven’t already given us, you can upload documents in your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) or the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app). Read more about how to [submit your Centrelink documents online](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online).

You can also give them to us by [mail, fax](/write-to-us#centrelink), or by [visiting a service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

You can also choose to bring a relative, friend or an advocate for support.

If you’d like [someone to deal with us on your behalf](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=60093), you need to confirm this with us before your DMA appointment.
