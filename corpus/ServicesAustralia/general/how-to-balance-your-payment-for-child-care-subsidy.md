For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB) or Child Care Subsidy (CCS), we need to balance your payments. We do this separately for each payment. Read more about:

-   [balancing for CCS](/balancing-child-care-subsidy?context=41186)
-   [balancing for FTB](/balancing-family-tax-benefit).

After 30 June, we confirm the amount of income you got during the financial year. We then compare this with the income estimate you gave us, your circumstances and child care attendance information. We do this to check that we paid you the right amount. This is what we call balancing your payments.

Most families need to confirm their income so we can start the balancing process. However, not everyone has to do the same thing for us to balance their payments.

Use our checker to see [what you need to do at tax time](/what-families-need-to-do-tax-time).
