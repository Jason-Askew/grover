# Balancing your family assistance payments

After the financial year ends, we balance your payments to make sure you got the right amount.

We balance family payments after the financial year ends. This is so we can check we paid you the right amount of Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS). We balance these separately.

Most families need to do something to balance their payments. What you need to do depends on the payment you get, as well as your family’s circumstances.

You can use our balancing checker to see [what you need to do at tax time](/what-families-need-to-do-tax-time).
