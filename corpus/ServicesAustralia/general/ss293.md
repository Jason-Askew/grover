# Relationship details - Separated under one roof form (SS293)

Use this form if you’re separated but live under the same roof as your ex-partner. This is so we can assess whether to pay you as a single person or as a member of a couple.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

You and your ex-partner will each need to complete a form.

If it puts you at risk, they don’t need to complete this form.

Download and complete the [Relationship details - Separated under one roof form](/sites/default/files/2025-07/ss293-2507en-f.pdf "PDF document").

You can send the link of the form to your ex-partner. They need to return their completed form to you, so you can submit it with yours.
