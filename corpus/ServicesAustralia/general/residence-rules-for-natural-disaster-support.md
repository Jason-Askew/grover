## To get NZ DRA

If on any day of the disaster you are an Australian citizen or a permanent resident visa holder, you must claim DRA instead of NZ DRA.

## Definitions

For residence rules, we use the following definitions.

Living in Australia

Living in Australia means Australia is your usual place of residence.

Australia also includes:

-   the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands
-   the Territory of Christmas Island
-   Norfolk Island
-   Lord Howe Island.

When we’re deciding if you live in Australia, we’ll look at the following:

-   where you live and who you live with
-   if you have family in Australia or overseas
-   your employment, business or financial ties in Australia and overseas
-   your assets in Australia and overseas
-   how often and how long you travel outside Australia
-   anything else we think is relevant.

Permanent residence visa

A permanent residence visa lets you stay in Australia indefinitely. This also allows you to claim all Centrelink payments and concession cards as an Australian resident if you’re living in Australia.

Protected Special Category Visa (SCV) holder

You’re generally a protected SCV holder if you arrived in Australia on a New Zealand passport, and were either:

-   in Australia on 26 February 2001
-   in Australia for 12 months in the 2 years immediately before this date
-   assessed as a protected SCV holder before 26 February 2004.

If you live in Australia and have a protected SCV, you can claim all Centrelink payments and concession cards.

Non-protected Special Category Visa (SCV) holder

You’re generally a non-protected SCV holder if you’re a New Zealand citizen who arrived in Australia after 26 February 2001. This means you’re not an Australian resident and generally can’t claim income support payments.

There are other payments and concession cards you may be able to claim, such as Family Tax Benefit and Australian Government natural disaster payments.
