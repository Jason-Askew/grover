# How much you can get

The amount of Farm Household Allowance you can get depends on your circumstances.

This payment is the same as the maximum rate of [JobSeeker Payment](/how-much-jobseeker-payment-you-can-get) or [Youth Allowance](/how-much-youth-allowance-for-job-seekers-you-can-get).

If you have a partner, we may pay the allowance to both of you. You may be able to submit a combined claim.

If you get Farm Household Allowance (FHA) you’ll get all the following:

-   a fortnightly payment for up to 4 years in each specific [10 year period](/time-limits-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161)
-   [activity supplements](/activity-supplement-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161) up to a lifetime limit of $10,000 to pay for activities to help improve your financial position
-   a Farm Household Case Officer to work with you to help you improve your financial circumstances.

FHA is a taxable Centrelink payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=22161).
