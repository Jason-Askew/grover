# How much you can get

The amount of Rent Assistance you can get depends on how much rent you pay.

-   [Rates when paid with income support payments and ABSTUDY](#a1)
-   [Rates when paid with Family Tax Benefit](#a2)
-   [People in different circumstances](#a3)
-   [Payment adjustments](#a4)

There’s a minimum amount of rent you need to pay to get Rent Assistance. For every $1 of rent you pay above this amount, you’ll get 75c. You can’t get more than the maximum amount.

We update Rent Assistance rates on 20 March and 20 September each year. This is in line with the Consumer Price Index.

## People in different circumstances

Special rules apply if you either:

-   are a single sharer
-   pay board and lodging.

The single sharer rate of Rent Assistance applies if you’re eligible and you:

-   are a single customer
-   have no dependent children
-   live in shared private accommodation.

You must also be getting one of the following payments:

-   [ABSTUDY - Living Allowance](/payment-special-rules-for-rent-assistance-eligibility?context=22206)
-   Age Pension
-   Austudy
-   Farm Household Allowance
-   [JobSeeker Payment](/payment-special-rules-for-rent-assistance-eligibility?context=22206)
-   Special Benefit
-   [Youth Allowance](/payment-special-rules-for-rent-assistance-eligibility?context=22206).

If you pay board and lodging, we work out how much you can get based on lodging only.

### If you can’t tell us what you pay for lodging

If you can’t tell us what you pay for lodging, we’ll use two thirds of the total board and lodging amount you pay as rent. If you’re sharing accommodation, you won’t get the single sharer rate, but you can get a different rate. We’ll work that out for you based on your circumstances.

Please [call us](/phone-us) on your main payment number for more information.

## Payment adjustments

We may adjust your Rent Assistance if any of these things happen:

-   the rent you pay increases or decreases
-   you move house
-   your income increases or decreases
-   your family circumstances change, for example you separate from your partner, or the number of children in your care changes.

We’ll also adjust the amount of Rent Assistance you get when the payment rates change during the year.

If any of these happen, you need to tell us. Read more about [change of circumstances when you get Rent Assistance](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-rent-assistance?context=22206).
