# How to apply

You can apply for a child support assessment online.

## on this page

-   [Before you start](#a1)
-   [Apply online](#apply)
-   [Apply over the phone](#a3)
-   [Withdraw application](#a4)
-   [Wait for the result](#a5)
-   [Set up self service](#a6)

After you apply for a child support assessment, we’ll assess your application and let you know the outcome.

If we grant your application, you’ll be able to set up self service and manage your child support online.

## Before you start

Before you start, you should:

-   check if you’re [eligible for child support](/child-support-assessment)
-   read about [how it works](/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-child-support-assessment?context=21911) before applying.

If you or the other parent live outside Australia, you may need to apply to that country’s child support authority. Read about [child support when a parent lives outside Australia](/child-support-when-parents-and-children-live-outside-australia).

### If asking for child support puts you at risk

If you’re worried about risks to you or your family when seeking child support, you can:

-   call the [Centrelink families line](#toolbar-phone) and ask to speak to a social worker
-   go to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) and ask to speak to a social worker.

If you’re affected by family or domestic violence, or at risk of it, you can:

-   call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732
-   go to the [1800RESPECT](http://www.1800respect.org.au/) website and select **Help and support**.

You can talk privately on the phone or online to someone who’s trained to help. It’s free and open 24/7.

## Apply online

The way you do this depends on whether you’re new to child support or you’re an existing customer with access to a Child Support online account through myGov.

You may need to give us other documents to support your application, such as a [Child Support statutory declaration](/cs4648). We’ll contact you if we need anything from you and we’ll let you know how to send it to us.

### If you’re new to Child Support

You can apply for a child support assessment online. Find out more about [how to apply](/how-to-apply-for-child-support-assessment?context=21911).

You’ll be asked to confirm if you have an existing child support case, or if you’re creating a new one. You’ll need to have your personal information ready.

[Apply for child support](https://childsupportapplication.servicesaustralia.gov.au/uafa)

If you live outside of Australia, use the [International application for an Australian child support assessment form](/cs1665) instead.

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Child Support online account, you should still submit your application. Once we’ve accepted your application, you’ll be able to [create a Child Support online](/create-online-account) account and link it to myGov.

### If you’re an existing Child Support customer

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to submit your form and supporting documents.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.csaonline.gov.au/csos_site/csos-base/basePage.jsf?wec-appid=cssr_app&wec-locale=en_US)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Child Support online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

## Apply over the phone

If you can’t apply online, [call the Child Support Enquiry Line](#toolbar-phone).

## Withdraw application

If we haven’t accepted or refused your application yet, you can withdraw it. If you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB), withdrawing your application may affect it. Find out more about [why you need to apply for child support while you get FTB Part A](/why-you-need-to-apply-for-child-support-while-you-get-ftb-part?context=21916).

Fill in the [Notice of withdrawal of application for a child support assessment form](/cs1669).

## Wait for the result

We’ll write to you and the other parent to tell you our decision.

If we make an assessment, we’ll send your child support assessment notice. This says:

-   how much you’ll receive or pay
-   when your payments will start.

### Check your details

Check that all your details on the assessment notice are right. You need to tell us if they aren’t or if they change later.

Changes to care arrangements can affect a child support assessment. You need to tell us about changes straight away. If you don’t tell us within 28 days any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.

Find out more about [how your percentage of care affects your child support payments](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-child-support-payments?context=21911).

### If you think our decision was wrong

If you don’t agree with a decision we’ve made you may be able to object. Both parents have the right to object.

Read about [objecting to Child Support decisions](/objections-to-child-support-decisions), including what you can and can’t object to.

### If we need to contact you

Once you have an assessment, we may need to contact you from time to time about your child support.

You can request how and when we contact you. To update your preferences, call us on the [Child Support Enquiry Line](#toolbar-phone).

Sometimes we may need to contact you using a different method or outside your preferred contact times. This may happen if:

-   we haven’t been able to reach you through your preferred method
-   you don’t make payments on time
-   we need to resolve a specific matter.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov you can update your contact details online. This includes your phone number and address.
