# How to manage your payment

Your options and obligations for Special Benefit.

When you get Special Benefit you may need to meet [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=22281).

We can help you better your chances of getting a job through an [Employment Services Assessment](/employment-services-assessments?context=22281) if you are impacted by barriers to work. This includes disability, illness or injury.

When you reach Age Pension age, you may want to [transfer to Age Pension](/transfer-to-age-pension?context=22281).

If you’re a veteran, you may need to choose between a [Veteran Payment or one of our income support payments](/veteran-payment-affects-your-income-support-payment?context=22281). You can’t get both.

If you get Special Benefit and you [overdraw your bank account](/overdrawn-bank-account?context=22281), talk to your bank to arrange a plan to repay the amount you owe.

## If you’re a parent or carer of a child aged under 6

Parent Pathways is a voluntary support service that can help you identify and achieve your future goals. The service is flexible and tailored to your individual circumstances.

You’ll work with a mentor who will support you during your time with Parent Pathways. You’ll also get tailored advice, guidance and resources in a supportive and safe environment, where your children are always welcome.
