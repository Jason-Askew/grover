# How much you can get

The amount of Special Benefit you can get depends on your circumstances.

The amount is usually the same as [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment) or [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance).

We update payment rates for Special Benefit on both of the following:

-   1 January each year if you’re under 21 and have no children
-   20 March and 20 September each year if you have dependent children or are 21 or older.

Special Benefit is a taxable Centrelink payment if you’re 16 or older. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=22281).

If you’re in financial hardship, you may be eligible for other support.

For more information, you can either:

-   call the [Employment services line](#toolbar-phone).
-   visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

Contact numbers available on this page.
