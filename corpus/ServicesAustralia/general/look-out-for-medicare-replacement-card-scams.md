Published: 13 February 2026

Scammers are sending text messages to people saying their Medicare card needs to be replaced or has been suspended.

These text messages are designed to trick you into giving away your personal and financial information.

The link takes you to a fake website that asks for your bank card details to pay the postage for a replacement card.

This is a scam. We don’t ask you to pay for a replacement Medicare card.

If you have given your financial details to a scammer, contact your bank straight away.
