# Verification of medical conditions form (SU684)

Use this form to provide details of your medical conditions. We’ll use this information to conduct an Employment Services Assessment.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Verification of medical conditions form](/sites/default/files/2025-08/su684-2508en-f.pdf "PDF document").

Only a medical practitioner, registered nurse, nurse practitioner or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioner can complete this form.

If they didn’t diagnose your medical condition, they must include the name of the medical practitioner who did.

This isn’t a medical certificate. If you need a temporary exemption from your mutual obligation, participation or study requirements, you can read about [getting a medical certificate](/getting-medical-certificate-for-jobseeker-payment?context=51411).
