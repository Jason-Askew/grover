# Ending

Find out what support you may get from us when you finish studying.

## on this page

-   [Further study](#a1)
-   [Apprenticeship or work](#a2)
-   [Tasks you can do online](#a3)

When you’ve finished your course, we may still be able to support you. This will depend on what you decide to do next.

If you get a student payment, you may be able to change to another [income support](/income-support-payment) payment after your course ends.

If you’re unsure what to do when your course ends, we can help. We have information to help you make a decision.

## Further study

You may want to study another course at a higher level. Depending on the course, you may still be able to get a payment from us. You’ll need to have some allowable time left.

Read about allowable or reasonable time for the student payment you get:

-   [Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices](/allowable-time-for-study-while-getting-youth-allowance)
-   [Austudy](/allowable-time-for-austudy?context=60078)
-   [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/reasonable-time-for-abstudy-living-allowance-and-abstudy-pensioner-education-supplement?context=60078).

## Apprenticeship or work

After studying, you may want to do extra training in an apprenticeship. We have payments and services that can support you as you [start an apprenticeship](/starting-apprenticeship-or-traineeship).

We can also support you while you’re [looking for work](/looking-for-work).

## Tasks you can do online

When you finish your course, you need to tell us. This is so we can pay you the right amount.

You can also apply to change to another payment from us if you need it.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to tell us about changes to your circumstances.

You can also tell us using either:

-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [Centrelink phone self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option, please call the [youth and students line](#toolbar-phone).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
