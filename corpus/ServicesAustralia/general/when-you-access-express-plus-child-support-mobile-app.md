The Express Plus Child Support mobile app is available for:

-   Apple devices with iOS 13.0 and above
-   Android devices with 8.0 and above.

We recommend you download updates when they’re available. You can change your device settings to allow automatic updates on your device.

If you have an outdated device or operating system, you can either:

-   update the latest software on your device
-   use your [Child Support online account](/child-support-online-accounts) through myGov.

This app isn’t available for Windows devices.

## Logout

Make sure you **Logout** every time you finish using the app. To logout, select the **Menu** icon on the home screen, then **Logout**.

The system will log you out if you haven’t used the app for 15 minutes or more.

## Lost or new device

Don’t save your PIN on your device. This will reduce the risk of someone else accessing your account.

If you get a new device, download the app again and create a new myGov PIN.
