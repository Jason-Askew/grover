## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with somatropin under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 100 for both:

-   patients aged 18 years or older
-   paediatric patients who have reached mature skeleton.

Where the patient has either:

-   late onset severe growth hormone deficiency
-   childhood onset severe growth hormone deficiency.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines restrictions for prescribing somatropin.

## Section 100 arrangements

### Somatropin

This item is PBS-subsidised under Section 100 Growth Hormone Program and can be dispensed by a:

-   community pharmacy
-   participating PBS reform public hospital pharmacy
-   private hospital pharmacy
-   dispensing doctor.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with somatropin, patients must be treated by an endocrinologist.

Authority applications to prescribe somatropin are assessed and approved by brand. You’ll need to specify the brand on the prescription along with the form and strength. For computer generated prescriptions, put the active ingredient first, followed by the brand. The prescription must include the form and strength.

Authority approvals are valid for the requested brand only and can’t be substituted at the pharmacy. If a patient requires a change in brand part way through the treatment course, you’ll need to submit a new authority application for approval.

Somatropin isn’t PBS-subsidised for patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome aged 18 years or older without a documented childhood onset Growth Hormone Deficiency.
