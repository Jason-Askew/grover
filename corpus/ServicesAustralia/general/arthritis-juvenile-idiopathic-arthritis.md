This includes adalimumab for patients with enthesitis/spondylitis related juvenile idiopathic arthritis and tocilizumab for patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with biological medicines under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 and/or section 100 for patients with severe active juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), enthesitis/spondylitis related JIA and systemic JIA.

Where the term **biological medicine** appears, it refers to adalimumab, etanercept, tocilizumab and tofacitinib.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing biological medicines.

## Section 100 arrangements

These items are only PBS-subsidised for non-admitted patients, day admitted patients, or patients on discharge who are attending either:

-   an approved private hospital
-   a public hospital.

These items aren’t PBS-subsidised for public hospital in-patients. You must include the hospital provider number for the authority application.
