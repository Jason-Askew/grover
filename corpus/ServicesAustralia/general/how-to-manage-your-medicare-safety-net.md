## Checking your Medicare Safety Net threshold

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to check your threshold amount.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also check your threshold by:

-   using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   calling the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone).

## Reaching a Medicare Safety Net threshold

If you’re an individual with no dependants, we’ll keep a tally of your out-of-pocket and gap amounts. Once you’ve reached the threshold, we’ll pay the higher Medicare benefit for the rest of the calendar year.

If you’re a registered family or couple, you’ll need to confirm who’s in your registered Medicare Safety Net family before you can get the higher Medicare benefits.

Read more about [what the Medicare Safety Nets thresholds are](/what-are-medicare-safety-nets-thresholds?context=22001).

If you haven’t registered for Medicare Safety Net as a family or couple, find out [how to register](/how-to-register-for-medicare-safety-nets?context=22001).

## Confirming your family

When your family is close to reaching a Medicare Safety Net threshold, we’ll ask you to confirm who’s in your registered Medicare Safety Net family. We’ll notify the nominated contact person for your family either by a myGov Inbox message or by post. The contact person may be you or someone else in your family.

If you’re the contact person or their partner, and your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to confirm your family.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

If you need help using your online account, read our [online guide for how to confirm your Medicare Safety Net family](/medicare-online-account-help-confirm-your-medicare-safety-net-family).

You can also confirm your family by:

-   using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   calling the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone).

## Letting us know when your family situation changes

If there are any changes to who’s in your registered Medicare Safety Net family, it’s important to let us know. You should let us know if any of the following happens:

-   you become a member of a couple
-   you have a baby
-   you adopt a child
-   you and your partner separate
-   your dependent child leaves your care.

If you’ve separated, it is important to update your personal details to [keep your information safe](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship).

You can let us know by either:

-   filling in the [Medicare Safety Net registration and amendment for couples and families form](/ms016)
