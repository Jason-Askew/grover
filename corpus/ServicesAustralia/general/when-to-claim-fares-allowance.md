# When to claim

You can get Fares Allowance after your journey or we can pre-book your travel for you.

To claim Fares Allowance for pre-booked travel or a reimbursement, you can either:

-   complete the [claim for Fares Allowance tertiary students only form](/sy005)
-   visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

You’ll need proof of your travel, including an itinerary and tax invoices.

You can call the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone) for more information, if you get:

-   Austudy
-   Pensioner Education Supplement
-   Youth Allowance.

## Wait for the results

If you get a reimbursement, we’ll pay it into the same bank account as your student payment.

You have the right to appeal our decision. Read about [reviews and appeals](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.
