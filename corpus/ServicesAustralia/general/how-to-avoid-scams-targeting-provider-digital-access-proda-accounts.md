# How to avoid scams targeting Provider Digital Access (PRODA) accounts

Scammers are targeting Services Australia online accounts including PRODA.

They often pretend to be from Services Australia, PRODA or myGov.

These scammers will send emails, text messages and social media messages. The message may include a link that will take you to a fake website designed to steal your information.

Scammers may message you and say:

-   there is a problem with your PRODA account or suspicious activity
-   changes have been made to your account
-   there are payments or refunds available
-   there are tasks requiring your action
-   there’s suspicious activity on your online account
-   your device needs to be authenticated.

These messages will tell you to click a link to:

-   sign in to your PRODA account
-   update your business or personal information
-   complete outstanding tasks.

Scammers may also call you. They’ll send you a message first, so the phone call isn’t unexpected. They do this to make the contact seem genuine.

They’ll then ask you for your personal information, including passwords for your online accounts. This is a scam.

Make sure you always sign in to your online accounts through official websites.

You can report scams pretending to be from PRODA to [reportascam@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:reportascam@servicesaustralia.gov.au).

If you need help with your PRODA account, call [PRODA Support](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).
