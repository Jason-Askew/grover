Health care locations need to use web services compatible software to access the following digital health channels:

-   Medicare Online including Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) and Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA)
-   Electronic Claim Lodgement and Information Processing Service Environment (ECLIPSE)
-   Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Online.

If you use an alternative channel and don’t use practice software to submit claims and data to us, you aren’t impacted. Find out more about the alternative [online services for health professionals](/online-services-for-health-professionals?context=20).

You need to register your organisation for [Provider Digital Access](/provider-digital-access-proda) (PRODA) to use these channels.
