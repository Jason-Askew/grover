## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with eculizumab and ravulizumab under the _National Health Act 1953_ section 100 for patients with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS).

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

You need to provide serial haematological results every 3 months while the patient is receiving treatment with each subsequent application for treatment.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing eculizumab and ravulizumab.
