## What to tell us

-   you apply for and get incontinence support from the National Disability Insurance Scheme
-   you [leave Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia) for more than 3 years.

They must also tell us if any of these change:

-   your personal circumstances
-   your personal and contact details
-   your address
-   your bank details
-   your care arrangements
-   your nominee details
-   your [gender identity](/updating-your-gender-details-with-us) - gender updates are optional.
