## Income test

You can earn some income and still get DSP. The amount depends on how much you earn.

Read more about the [income test for DSP](/income-test-for-disability-support-payment?context=22276).

## Assets test

You can have some assets and still get DSP. The amount depends on how much your assets are worth.

Read more about the [assets test for DSP](/assets-test-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

## Asset hardship provisions

[Asset hardship provisions](/asset-hardship-provisions?context=22276) could apply if you’re in severe financial hardship and you either:

-   can’t get a payment from us because your assets are over the asset test cut off point
-   have had your payment reduced under the assets test.

## Exemptions

You may not be subject to the income or assets test if you’re permanently blind, unless either:

-   you’re claiming [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance)
-   your partner claims an [income support payment](/income-support-payment).

## Compensation

The amount we pay you could change if you or your partner get paid for [compensation](/centrelink-compensation-recovery) for damages.

## Income maintenance period

If you’ve recently stopped working, an [income maintenance period](/income-maintenance-period?context=22276) may apply. For this period, you may get a reduced payment rate or you may not get any payment.
