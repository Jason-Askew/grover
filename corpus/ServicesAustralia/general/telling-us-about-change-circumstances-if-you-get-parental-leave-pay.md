# Telling us about a change of circumstances

You need to tell us if your circumstances change when you get Parental Leave Pay.

-   [What to tell us](#a1)
-   [How to tell us](#a2)

## What to tell us

You need to tell us if any of the following things happen:

-   you need to change a day because you have worked or are planning to work on a day you wanted to get Parental Leave Pay
-   you’re no longer caring for your child
-   you [change or correct your name](#changingname)
-   your personal or contact details change
-   you’re [leaving Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=64479#leavingaustralia), temporarily or to live somewhere else.

You need to tell us about a change in your circumstances straight away. For some changes, if you don’t, we may pay you too much. This means you’ll have a [debt](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments) you need to pay back.

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov and we’ve assessed your Parental Leave Pay claim, you can tell us about most changes online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **My family**, then **Parental Leave Pay Circumstances**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If we haven’t assessed your claim yet, call the [Centrelink families line](#toolbar-phone).

### Changing or correcting your name

It’s important to tell us if you [change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink).

Contact numbers available on this page.

Monday to Friday 8 am to 8 pm

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income. We may have sent your child a letter asking for this in September or October, read how you can [update your income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
