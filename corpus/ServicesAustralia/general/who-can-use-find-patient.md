# Who can use Find a Patient

You need a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to find your patient details in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

Find a Patient allows providers and delegates to use a PRODA account to find patient details in HPOS. If you don’t have one, [register for PRODA online](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

This means you can search and immediately confirm:

-   patient Medicare numbers
-   concessional eligibility
-   patient details.

You can use an [individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account) to access Find a Patient if you either:

-   have a Medicare provider number
-   are delegated access by someone with a Medicare provider number.

The following services can set up an [organisation PRODA account](/how-to-register-organisation-proda) to access Find a Patient:

-   hospitals
-   approved Indigenous and Remote Health Services with a Medicare claiming need
-   pharmacies.

Your organisation’s administrator will need to do both of the following:

-   [Link HPOS to your organisation in PRODA](/adding-and-linking-to-hpos-for-patient-verification)
-   [Add you as a member of the organisation PRODA account](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda#step2).

If you’re a pharmacy, you’ll need to [link HPOS using your pharmacy approval number](/adding-and-linking-to-hpos-for-pbs). You can then [log in to your individual PRODA account](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1) to access Find a Patient.

Once you have access to HPOS using PRODA, you can use it to find [patient details](/patient-details-hpos?context=20#accordion1) in HPOS.
