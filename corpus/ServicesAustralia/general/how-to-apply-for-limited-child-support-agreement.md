-   [Submit your application](#a2)
-   [Application outcome](#a3)

The next steps are to:

-   decide if you'll negotiate a limited child support agreement with the other parent
-   use the Child Support Agreement form or draft your terms separately
-   submit your agreement and any supporting documents
-   apply for acceptance of the agreement either in writing or over the phone.

## Making a limited child support agreement

You can use the [Child Support Agreement form](/cs1666) to record your agreement or you can record it in a separate document. The agreement can outline child support payments of cash and non-cash items, such as school fees and health insurance.

Parents can sign the same child support agreement, or each sign separate identical copies, but the agreement must be signed by both parents.

Read more [about limited child support agreements](/what-you-need-to-do-for-limited-child-support-agreement?context=21921).

It’s good to remember that you can also seek legal advice when making a limited child support agreement, although it isn’t a requirement.

## Submit your application

You must have a [child support assessment](/child-support-assessment) before applying for a limited child support agreement to be accepted.
