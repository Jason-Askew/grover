# While you wait

There are some things you can do while you wait for your Carer Allowance claim outcome.

## on this page

-   [Checking where your claim is up to](#a1)
-   [Accessing other help](#a2)

Carer situations are complex and it can take some time to assess your situation.

We’ll contact you if we need any more information to support your claim so we can fully understand your situation and the support you need.

We’ll never ask you for money to release your information or fix your account. Read more about [How to protect against scams](/how-to-protect-against-scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271).

## Checking where your claim is up to

To track the status of your claim you can use either:

-   your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

You can also use your online account to:

-   check our messages
-   update your details and tell us of any changes
-   withdraw your application.

## Accessing other help

We have a range of income support payments that you can claim while you’re caring for someone such as:

-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
