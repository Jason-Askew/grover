# Update your details on the AIR

How to control who sees your record on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) and getting letters about your record.

You can decide if vaccination providers can see your immunisation record on the AIR. You can also choose not to get letters from the AIR if you don’t want them.

## Accessing AIR records

Vaccination providers can see your record on the AIR unless you choose not to share it.

If you have a child under 14, you can also control who sees their record. Once your child turns 14, it’s their choice. They can decide if they want to share their immunisation history or not.

If you choose not to share your immunisation history, even your GP can’t see your AIR record. If so, they might have to ask you questions about the immunisations you’ve had. This will help them make decisions about the vaccinations you need.

You need to tell us if you want to change who can see your record.

To do this, complete the [Australian Immunisation Register – ceasing correspondence and release of information form](/im017). The postal address is on the form.

## Getting AIR reminder letters

Parents will get reminder letters for their children under 14 who are overdue for immunisations.

If you get a reminder letter for your child, it will say what immunisations are overdue. Visit your vaccination provider and talk to them about getting your child up to date.

If your child’s immunisations are overdue it may affect some family assistance payments.

You need to tell us if you don’t want to get these letters.

To do this, complete the [Australian Immunisation Register ceasing correspondence and release of information form](/im017). The postal address is on the form.

## Updating your details

Make sure we have the correct name and date of birth for you and your child. If they’re incorrect, you’ll need to visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) to fix them.

If your details are wrong on the AIR they may also be wrong on your Medicare card. Read more about how to [update your personal details](/how-you-update-your-name-date-birth-or-gender-for-medicare#updatingname) on a Medicare card.

If you’re not eligible for Medicare and need to update your details, you can call the [Australian Immunisation Register](/phone-us#air).
