## Seeing a doctor

To find a doctor in your area, you can use the [find a health service tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) on the healthdirect website.

You can search for the kind of doctor you need and find out if they bulk bill.

It’s best to bring your [Medicare card](/medicare-card) or number with you when you see your doctor.

### Telehealth appointments

You may be able to make a video or phone appointment if you can’t go to the doctors office.

This includes appointments with the following types of health professionals:

-   GP
-   specialist
-   allied health professional
-   nurse practitioner
-   obstetrician
-   registered midwife.

They may choose to bulk bill your appointment. Contact their office to check if they’ll bulk bill before you make an appointment.

## Going to hospital

You may need to go to a hospital emergency department if you’re badly hurt or sick. Hospital emergency departments are open 24 hours a day.

To find a hospital near you, you can use the [find a health service tool](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) on the healthdirect website.

It’s best to take your Medicare card or number with you when you go to hospital.

We cover your costs if you’re a public patient in a public hospital.

### Ambulances

We don’t cover the cost of emergency transport or ambulance services to hospital.

Ambulance costs are different in each state and territory. This also applies if you’re on holiday. These links will take you away from our website.
