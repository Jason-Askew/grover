# How much you can get

The amount of Away from Base Assistance you can get depends on the costs involved in you attending the activity. It also depends on how the activity has been arranged.

If you’re eligible for it, you may be eligible for assistance to cover [meals and accommodation costs](/abstudy-away-from-base-assistance-for-meals-and-accommodation-costs?context=53534). You may also be eligible to get help with travel costs under [ABSTUDY Fares Allowance](/abstudy-fares-allowance).

If you’ll lose your regular source of income while doing an away from base activity, let us know. We may be able to pay you [ABSTUDY Living Allowance](/abstudy-living-allowance) for that time. Your regular source of income could be either:

-   an income support payment
-   a job where you must use leave without pay to attend the activity.
