# How to use the service

You can access Electronic Verification of Rent (EVoR) from within our secure online site. You must have customer consent from your tenant before you use it.

-   [Single entry service](#a2)
-   [Batch entry service](#a3)

After you get customer consent you can log on to [Centrelink Business Online Services](https://business.centrelink.gov.au/LoginServices/source/VANguard/ValidateBAN.jsp?finalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.humanservices.gwy%2FLoginServices%2FAuthenticate.do) and use EVoR. You can use it each time there is a change to your tenants’ rent details.

Read more about your [obligations when using EVoR](/what-your-businesses-obligations-for-electronic-verification-rent-evor-are?context=23176).

## Tell us about rent changes

You must update your tenants’ rent details between 15 and 50 days before the rent changes using EVoR. You can’t make the rent update through EVoR outside this timeframe. Tenants will need to verify their rent to us another way.

You can use EVoR for single or batch updates.

## Single entry service

You can use the single entry service to both:

-   search for a single mutual customer
-   view or update rent details for one customer.

## Batch entry service

You can use the batch entry service to do all of these:

-   submit a single file to update rent details for multiple customers
-   compose new mail messages
-   get a detailed report with each update.

You can access an EVoR user guide by selecting **help** from within Centrelink Online Business Services. The guide has step by step details about how to use the service.
