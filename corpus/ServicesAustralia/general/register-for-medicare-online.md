## Register for Medicare Online

To register for Medicare Online and submit online claims from any location through your practice management software (PMS), you need to:

1.  Check your PMS is compatible.
2.  Register for a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) individual or organisation account.
3.  Register for online claiming.

## Check your practice management software

We must approve your PMS for it to support Medicare Online claiming. Check with your software developer if your operating system is compatible and your software can:

-   submit different types of claims such as bulk billing, and patient and Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) claims
-   send Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) data for notification of immunisations
-   complete online patient verification or online concession entitlement verification.

-   complete the [Banking details - online claiming form (HW052)](/hw052?context=20) for each additional practice location
-   get each health professional in your practice to sign the relevant online agreement if you’re registering on their behalf, so we can access their Medicare records.
