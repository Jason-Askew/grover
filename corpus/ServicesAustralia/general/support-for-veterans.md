# Support for veterans

We can help veterans and their families at our service centres.

-   [ADF Transition Guide](#a1)
-   [Engage service finder](#a2)

If you can’t connect with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) online or by telephone we can help. You can now get free face-to-face help through all our service centres and Mobile Service Centres. You don’t need to make an appointment.

This arrangement doesn’t affect the DVA’s Veterans’ Affairs Network (VAN) offices. If you have a VAN office nearby, you can still access all services there. You can [search for a DVA office near you](https://www.dva.gov.au/location-finder) on the DVA website.

If you come into a service centre or mobile service centre, we can help with all of the following:

-   connecting to the [DVA phone line](https://www.dva.gov.au/about-us/contact-us#call-us)
-   creating and navigating a MyService account
-   accessing the DVA website
-   printing documents from MyService or DVA website from a self-service terminal
-   checking DVA forms contain the right information and verifying documents
-   forwarding documents to DVA
-   connecting with DVA support services such as Open Arms - Veterans and Families Counselling.

In addition, 22 of our regional service centres provide extra Veterans’ Information Services (VIS). At VIS sites, we can do all of the following:

-   answer enquiries about DVA payments and services
-   give you DVA forms, information products and publications
-   advise you of your rights, obligations and complaint processes
-   refer you to pension or welfare officers in Ex-Services Organisations (ESO) for assistance
-   refer you to specialist areas of DVA or other government and non-government agencies.

## ADF Transition Guide

The ADF Transition Guide is a free mobile app to support Australian Defence Force members transition from service to civilian life. It can also help family, friends and support persons to understand and support the transition.

The app brings together resources, information and support services conveniently in the one place to help you with your transition.
