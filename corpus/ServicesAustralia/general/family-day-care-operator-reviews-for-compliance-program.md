The Department of Education may tell us that you’ve been working as a Family Day Care educator. If they do, we’ll send you a letter asking you to contact us to confirm or update your details. We’ll do this if you haven’t already told us you’re working as a Family Day Care educator.

## What details we need

When you contact us we’ll ask you about your Family Day Care work to find out:

-   when you started working as a Family Day Care educator
-   if you’re still working
-   if you’re no longer working, and if so, when you stopped
-   if you have contracts with any service providers, past and present
-   how you’re paid, for example, by a provider or parents, or through a bank account or cash
-   the services you provide
-   the ages of the children you educate
-   the number of hours a day, days per week, and weeks each year you provide care.

You must answer as accurately as you can.

## Details about your tax returns and payment history

We’ll need details about your lodged individual and business tax returns with the Australian Taxation Office, including both a:

-   breakdown of expenses
-   depreciation worksheet with details of the assets purchased.

We’ll also need a copy of your Education Payment History Reports for the financial years your business has been operating.

## When you haven’t lodged your tax returns

You may need to give us a [Profit and Loss Statement](/su580) form if either:

-   you haven’t lodged your tax returns
-   your income has changed since your last tax return.

## What other information we need

Depending on your circumstances, we may also ask for:

-   your Tax Assessment Notice for a particular financial year
-   your bank statements
-   copies of receipts for expenses listed in your tax returns.

We may also ask you for the following forms:

-   [Business details](/mod-f) form
-   [Real estate details form](/mod-r)
-   [Private Company form](/mod-pc)
-   [Private Trust form](/mod-pt).

When giving us this information, you should consider the following.

### Details about purchases you’ve made for your business

You need to consider:

-   assets you’ve purchased to operate your business that you haven’t told us about
-   the cost of the asset
-   the percentage you use the asset for your business
-   if you give food, meals or snacks to children in your care.

### Details about your property

If you run your business from your home, you’ll need to tell us all of the following:

-   how many rooms are in your house and how many of those you use for Family Day Care
-   if you use any of your rooms only for Family Day Care
-   your total annual household costs if you had any household expenses for your Family Day Care business, like utilities, phone, internet and insurance.

We may also ask you:

-   if you own or rent your home
-   the amount of rent you pay each week or the mortgage amount you pay each month.

### Details about car use

If you use your car to run your business, you’ll need to tell us:

-   that you need the car for your business

Examples of how you may work out motor vehicle use include:

-   1/3 of actual expenses.
