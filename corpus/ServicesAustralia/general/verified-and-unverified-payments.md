# Verified and unverified payments

Verified payments count towards your thresholds, while unverified payments don’t.

Verified payments are when you pay for your health professional service in full before you make a claim from us. When this happens, your gap amount and out of pocket costs count towards your thresholds.

Unverified payments are when you don’t pay for the service in full before you claim from us. When this happens, your gap amount and out of pocket costs don’t count towards your thresholds.

Once you’ve paid the service, mail or bring the receipt to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/). We’ll include the out of pocket costs towards your Medicare Safety Net threshold.

You can use your [Medicare Online Account](/medicare-online-account) to get a statement of your unverified payments.
