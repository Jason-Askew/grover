For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

We often see the best come out in people and communities affected by a natural disaster. Most people want to do the right thing and help if they can. But there are others who try to take advantage of this stressful time.

We use enhanced scam and fraud prevention capabilities to protect people and their communities.

## Avoiding scams

Scams can be hard to spot. Scammers may send emails and messages that say:

-   you’re eligible for a payment
-   you need to claim urgently
-   you need to update your details with us.

The messages tell you to click on a link to sign in to myGov. The link takes you to a fake myGov website.

Scammers use these websites to take your personal information, including your myGov sign in details, and then steal your payments.

To avoid your information getting into the wrong hands:

-   don’t click on links in text messages or emails
-   be careful of unexpected contact where there is a sense of urgency or a deadline
-   don’t give access to your computer or electronic devices to someone you don’t know
-   keep your personal information secure, including your myGov sign in details
-   create a myGov passkey or connect a Digital ID and turn off your password as a sign in option, if your device supports it
-   choose strong passwords and set up extra security options to sign in, if you prefer not to use passkeys
-   only sign in to your myGov account by going to my.gov.au or the official myGov app.

See [active scams](/active-scams) for more information about scams impersonating our programs and learn [how to know if it’s a scam](/how-scams-work?context=60271).

Some people might say they can help you claim a payment from us if you pay them a fee. We can always help you claim and will never ask you to pay for our help, payments or services.

If you think you’ve been scammed, read [what to do if a scam has affected you](/help-if-scam-or-identity-theft-has-affected-you).

## Avoiding fraud

We know most people are honest and do the right thing. Unfortunately, some people deliberately give us the wrong information to try and claim disaster payments they’re not eligible for.

We need to make sure that our payments only go to those who are eligible for them. That’s why we have strong measures in place to detect and prevent fraud.

If we find someone has fraudulently claimed a payment they weren’t eligible for, they’ll need to pay it back and we may refer them for prosecution.

If you suspect someone may be committing fraud, you should [report it](/report-fraud?context=64107).

## Making sure your claim is right

It’s important to make sure your claim is accurate, so you only get payments you’re eligible for. If you get a payment you’re not eligible for, you may have to pay it back.If you’re not sure if you’re eligible for a payment, you can do any of the following:

-   check eligibility for disaster payments on our website, or read our [Understanding government disaster support](/understanding-government-disaster-support?context=60042) page
-   ask us on social media
-   call our [Emergency information line](#toolbar-phone)
-   visit us in person.

If we need more information about your claim, we’ll call you. If you’re not sure it’s us, you can hang up and call us back on our [Emergency information line](#toolbar-phone).

## Keeping your details up to date

It’s important to keep your details with us up to date. It helps ensure you get the right payment, and the right amount.

Your personal information must be correct and based on your actual circumstances.

You can keep your details up to date by:

-   telling us about any [changes to your circumstances](/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment)
-   regularly checking your information is up to date using your Centrelink online account through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/).

You’ll need to tell us if your income before tax is more than the average Australian weekly income if you get:

-   Disaster Recovery Allowance
-   New Zealand Disaster Recovery Allowance.

It’s never too late to report a change. By telling us about any changes today, we can help make sure you get the correct payment.
