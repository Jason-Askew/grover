# Helping someone who’s leaving prison

Corrective services can help someone who's leaving prison to access our payments and services, helping them on their release.

-   [Apply for a payment](#a1)
-   [Update child support](#a2)
-   [Stop a nominee arrangement](#a3)
-   [Other support](#a4)

People who are leaving prison may need help with their finances and other arrangements. They can access payments and services, manage child support and update nominee arrangements.

## Apply for a payment

People who are leaving prison can call us 21 days before their release date on the dedicated prison phone line. We can help them arrange:

-   a [Crisis Payment](/crisis-payment)
-   a Hardship Advance Payment
-   other [income support payments](/income-support-payment).

## Update child support

If they paid or received child support before they entered prison, they should contact us before their release to make sure any debts and ongoing payments are correct.

They can call Child Support on the dedicated prison phone line.

## Stop a nominee arrangement

While in prison they may have asked someone to act on their behalf, we call this a nominee arrangement. Now they’re leaving they may want this arrangement to continue or stop.

They can stop or cancel a nominee arrangement by calling us on the dedicated prison phone line.

## Other support

When people leave prison they can get help from a range of other services. They can find more information about [housing, social work services and mental health support](/support-when-you-leave-prison#othersupport).
