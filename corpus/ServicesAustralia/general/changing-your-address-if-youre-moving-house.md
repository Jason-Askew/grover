# Changing your address

Learn about what you need to tell us when you move house and how it can affect your payments.

-   [How to update your address](#a2)
-   [How changing your address may affect your payment](#a3)
-   [When you downsize](#a4)

## Why you should tell us

When you’re moving house, you need to let us know. You should update your address within 14 days, even if you don’t get a payment from us.

This is so we can get in touch with you if we need to. If you get a payment, it also helps us make sure we’re paying you the right amount.

Changing your address can involve:

-   moving into another home
-   selling your principal home for example, downsizing
-   temporary vacation of the principal home to rebuild, repair or renovate
-   moving to provide care for someone
-   moving into care
-   moving into aged care, such as a nursing home.

### If you’re in-between home addresses

If you’re in between home addresses, keep us up to date and tell us where to send your mail so you can get it.

You can tell us about a home address you are moving to in the future but we can only send your mail there from the date you’ve told us you’ll be living there. However, while you’re waiting for this to happen, it’s important you give us a secure mailing address. If you don’t, your mail will go to the last mailing address you gave us.

It’s important to keep your addresses up to date using your [Centrelink online account through myGov](/centrelink-online-account-help-update-address-accommodation-and-contact-details).

If you are living with violence or abuse, or separating from your partner, you should review all addresses we have recorded for you. This can help to keep your information secure.

## How to update your address

If you update your address in your myGov account, it will send your new information to some of your linked services automatically.

### If you’re renting and you get a payment from us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you should update your details online. We’ll then be able to automatically assess you for [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance). If you update your details another way, we can’t automatically assess you for Rent Assistance.

### If you’re not renting

You can update your details in your [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) account, or separately in your Medicare, Centrelink or Child Support online accounts.

If you don’t have any of these you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

If you can’t update your details online you can [call us](/phone-us) on your regular payment line.

## How changing your address may affect your payment

If you get a payment from us, we include most real estate assets you own in the assets test. The only real estate asset we don’t include is your principal home.

Read about how [real estate assets](/real-estate-assets?context=22196) affect your payment and what happens when you leave your principal home.

## When you downsize

If you decide to downsize and your address changes, you’ll need to update your details with us.

Downsizing can involve:

-   moving into a smaller home
-   selling assets
-   moving into care
-   moving into aged care, such as a nursing home.

If you’re downsizing, you may also be thinking about retirement.

Read about [retirement](/retirement-years) and what help you may get if you decide to stop working.

Depending on your age, when you downsize you may be able to add excess funds to your superannuation. This may affect your Centrelink income support payment. Before you make a decision, we recommend you either:

-   seek professional advice
-   speak to one of our [Financial Information Service](/financial-information-service) Officers to discuss your options.
