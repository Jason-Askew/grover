# Before claiming

We can help you work out if you may be able to get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

## 1: Before you start a claim

When you claim Disability Support Pension (DSP), we [assess](/how-we-assess-your-claim-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) if you meet both non-medical and medical rules.

This guide can help you understand the rules for DSP and decide whether to make a claim.

It will ask you a question and, based on your answer, show you another question or result.

## 2: Do you meet the age rules?

You must be aged from 16 up to Age Pension age.

If you don’t know what the Age Pension age is, read about [who can get it](/who-can-get-age-pension?context=22526).
