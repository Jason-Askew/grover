# Update your bank details as an aged care provider

Register or change your bank account details in the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

It’s important you keep your details up to date so we can pay you.

You’ll need an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to access the [Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP)](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

You’ll need to have the required level of access to follow the steps to update your bank details.

## Register or change your bank details

1.  From the **Bank account summary** screen, select **Register bank details** to register new or change existing bank details.
2.  Download and complete the [Application to add or change approved care service’s bank details form (AC015)](/ac015?context=20).
3.  Select **Confirm** to continue.
4.  On the **Register bank details** screen, enter your BSB, account number and account name.
5.  A **Receipt** screen will display **SUCCESS: the bank details are registered and pending approval**.
6.  Go to the **Bank account documents** screen by selecting Go to **document upload** on the **Receipt** screen.
7.  In the **Upload documents** section, select **Select document**.
8.  Select and open the completed AC015 form file and select **Attach documents**.
9.  A **Successful confirmation** message will display.

We’ll need to view the [Application to add or change approved care service’s bank details form (AC015)](/ac015?context=20) and approve the changes before they’re updated in the portal.
