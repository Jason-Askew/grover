# Claiming as a higher education student or Australian Apprentice

Complete the steps on this page to claim ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance. Before you start, check if you can get it.

When claiming an ABSTUDY payment we calculate and pay the allowance as part of that claim. You don’t need to do a separate claim.

You can claim up to 13 weeks before you start your course or apprenticeship.

## Steps to claim ABSTUDY Incidentals Allowance as a tertiary student or Australian Apprentice

1.  ### 1\. Get ready to claim
    
    The easiest way to claim is online.
    
    To claim online, you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [set them up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=39366).
    
    You’ll need a Customer Reference Number (CRN) to link your Centrelink online account to myGov.
    
    If you ever got a payment from us you’ll still have a CRN, CRNs don’t change.
    
    If you don’t have a CRN, you’ll need to [prove your identity](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink?context=39366) online through myGov to get one.
    
    If you can’t get a CRN online, you can call us on the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).
    
2.  ### 2\. Get your documents ready to claim
    
    You’ll need to get some [supporting documents](/supporting-documents-for-your-centrelink-claim?context=39366) ready to help answer some of the questions in the claim. We’ll need your bank account details and your course details.
    
3.  ### 3\. Make your claim

    -   on the phone by calling us on the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone) and we’ll help you claim
