# Manage delegations

You can nominate someone to do tasks on your behalf in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). When you do this, that person becomes your delegate.

The person you nominate must have their own (PRODA) account.

Administrative staff can also request delegation access through HPOS. Administrative staff can be delegates for multiple providers.

Delegation functions

Delegates have access to a range of functions, services and information in HPOS. As the health professional, you can allocate the functions in HPOS that you’d like your delegate to be able to access on your behalf.

At your discretion, your delegate can access the following HPOS functions:

-   Messages
-   Statements and Subscriptions
-   Secure Form Upload
-   Online Forms
-   Find a patient and patient profile
-   View patient care plan history
-   Multiple details request.

At your discretion, your delegate can access the following programs and services using HPOS:

Delegation requests and renewals

You and your administrative staff can manage new delegation requests and delegation renewals.

Your delegates can:

-   submit a new request for delegation access to you for approval
-   submit a request to you to renew their delegation end date.

As a health professional, you can:

-   set up a new delegation
-   approve or decline a new delegation request or renewal request
-   update a delegation end date before it expires.

Delegation requests and renewals must be actioned within 14 days.

Delegation expiry

When you approve a delegate, they can act on your behalf for 12 months. You can approve a delegation request to expire before 12 months. Delegates can also request their delegation to expire before 12 months.

You’ll need to renew all delegations after either:

-   the default 12-month period
-   the period they’re set up for.

You and your delegate will get an expiry warning notification in your HPOS mailboxes before the delegation expires. The only exception is if the delegation period is less than 14 days.
