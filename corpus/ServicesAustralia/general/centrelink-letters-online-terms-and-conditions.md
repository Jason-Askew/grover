# Terms and conditions

If you choose to get Centrelink letters online, we'll stop sending most letters to your mailing address.

You’ll get a welcome letter in your myGov Inbox. This confirms you have subscribed to the service.

Your letters may be held as a temporary file on the computer’s hard drive when you view them.

If you’re using a public computer, make sure you remove the temporary files before you log off.

You don’t have to get your Centrelink letters online if you don’t want. You can withdraw anytime through your Centrelink online account or by contacting us on the [Online Services Support Hotline](#toolbar-phone). Your information is protected by laws, such as the _Privacy Act 1988_ and the confidentiality provisions in Social Security law.

Your letters will be in the same format as they currently are on paper. This means that the letter may include your:

-   name, address, and [Customer Reference Number (CRN)](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn)
-   payment, income and assets, and bank account details.

You need to check your myGov Inbox regularly for online letters.

Contact numbers available on this page.
