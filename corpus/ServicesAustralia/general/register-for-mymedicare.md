## How to register a child under 14 years using Medicare Online Account

A child under 14 years can be registered for My Medicare by a parent or guardian. To register a child:

-   they must be on the same card as the registering parent or guardian
-   they can only be registered with one general practice at a time and with one preferred GP.

If a current registration exists, the child must be withdrawn before a new registration can be initiated.

The registering parent or guardian will have access to view and edit MyMedicare registration information for the child under 14 years using Medicare online services.

A non-registering parent or guardian for a child under 14 on the same card will only see if the child is currently registered for MyMedicare or not and withdraw the registration.

MyMedicare notifications will be sent to the registering parent or guardian while the child under 14 years remains on the same card.

Children under 14 years must be on the same card as the parent or guardian to be registered online.

To be eligible to register for MyMedicare, children under 14 must have visited the practice in person twice in the last 24 months or once in 24 months if in a rural remote location or the child is being registered to the same practice as the registering parent/guardian.

10.  **Read** parent/guardian **declaration**.
11.  Select **Submit registration** acknowledging declaration and completing the child’s registration.
12.  If the practice prefers to manually accept registrations, an **Awaiting outcome** message will appear on screen. The practice has 30 days to accept the request. A notification will be sent once registration is accepted.
