## If we contact you

From time to time we’ll contact you. If you’ve set up your myGov Inbox we can send you an SMS or email to let you know there’s a new letter. Otherwise we’ll send it through the post.

Learn how to [set up online account notifications](/set-your-notifications-for-centrelink-letters-online).

We’ll contact you before a child you care for is about to turn 16 years, or 18 years for a child with a terminal illness. If you continue to provide care, to keep your payment you’ll need to [transfer Carer Payment from child to adult](/transfer-carer-payment-and-carer-allowance-from-child-to-adult?context=21816).

We’ll also contact you before you reach Age Pension age. This is so we can help you [prepare to transfer to Age Pension](/prepare-to-transfer-to-age-pension-if-you-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

You don’t have to transfer, we’ll send you a letter to help you [choose between Carer Payment and Age Pension](/choosing-between-carer-payment-and-age-pension).

We may also contact you and ask you to do a review to check if you can keep getting Carer Payment.
