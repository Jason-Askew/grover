# Program of Support

You may need to participate in a Program of Support before you claim Disability Support Pension (DSP).

A Program of Support (POS) helps people with disability to prepare for, find and keep a job. It may include help with:

-   job preparation and job search
-   work experience and training
-   injury management.

## Who doesn’t have to participate

You don’t need to take part in a POS if we assess that you either:

-   meet [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   have an [impairment rating](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) of 20 points or more on a single Impairment Table.

Read more about [Impairment Tables](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers-benefits-payments/impairment-tables-for-disability-support-pension) on the Department of Social Services (DSS) website. They also have an easy read guide that you can download or listen to.

For example, we assess Kate’s impairment rating as 30 points from a single Impairment Table. This means Kate doesn’t need to do a POS.

## Who must participate

You need to participate if both:

-   your total impairment rating is 20 points or more
-   you have less than 20 points on a single Impairment Table.

For example, we assess Mike’s medical conditions as 10 points on one Impairment Table and 10 points on another Impairment Table.

Mike’s total impairment rating is 20 points, but less than 20 points on a single Impairment Table.

This means Mike needs to participate in a POS.

## How to show you’ve participated

To show you’ve participated in a POS in the 3 years before you claim DSP, you must either:

-   participate for at least 18 months
-   complete the program if it went for less than 18 months.

If you get an income support payment such as [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment) or [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment), we’ll assess what you’ve done to meet either your:

-   [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=22276)
-   participation requirements.

If you claim DSP, we’ll check if your participation meets POS requirements.

## What counts as participation

You need to actively participate in a POS for it to count. Any periods where you don’t participate won’t count.

Sometimes you may need an exemption from your mutual obligation or participation requirements. For example, when you give us a [medical certificate](/getting-medical-certificate-for-jobseeker-payment) showing you can’t work. You can talk to your provider about how they can support you to continue your POS during this time. This may help you complete your participation requirements for POS.

Your medical condition or disability may stop you from improving your ability to work by staying in a POS. In this case, a shorter period may count.

### Example where Jess’s POS stopped due to her condition

Jess is 32 and lives in a remote community. She worked as a tour guide until she suffered serious injuries in a car accident.

After her recovery, Jess found it hard to concentrate and remember things. She was unable to go back to her job. She looked for other work and took part in the Community Development Program (CDP) for 11 months.

Her condition got worse over time and doctors told her she would be unable to return to work.

Jess submits a claim for DSP. As part of her claim, she needs to go to a Job Capacity Assessment. The assessor uses 2 Impairment Tables to give Jess a combined impairment rating of 20 points.

Jess now needs to show she’s participated in a POS in the 3 years before her claim. Jess tells the assessor about her time in the CDP.

The assessor accepts that Jess couldn’t further improve her ability to work by staying in the program.

Jess meets the requirements. She can get DSP.

### Example where Tony didn’t start a program

Tony has worked in a store for 35 years. Due to failing health, he has been finding it more difficult to do physical work, so he resigns.

He submits a claim for DSP a few months later. As part of his claim, Tony needs to go to a Job Capacity Assessment. The assessor uses 2 Impairment Tables to give Tony a total combined impairment rating of 20 points.

Tony now needs to show he participated in a POS in the 3 years before claiming DSP.

Tony never started a POS before he claimed DSP.

Tony can’t get DSP as he doesn’t meet the POS requirements.

### If your participation is affected by other circumstances

In the 3 years before you claim, if an emergency impacted your participation in POS, a shorter participation period may count. This may include impacts such as any natural disasters or emergency health measures. If you have any questions about your participation in a POS, call us on the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone). You can also visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

### Claiming DSP again if you’ve participated in a POS

If we rejected your DSP claim because you didn’t meet POS requirements, we can reassess your participation in a POS. This applies if you’ve either:

-   now completed a POS for the required period
-   started a POS but your medical condition or disability stops you from improving your ability to work by staying in a POS.

To do this, you need to [reclaim DSP](/claiming-again-disability-support-pension?context=22276) again and provide evidence of your participation.

## Who the POS providers are

The following POS providers can work with you to help you prepare for, find and keep a job. They may help you look for a job, study or get work experience.

If you need to complete a POS, we can help to refer you to a suitable POS provider.
