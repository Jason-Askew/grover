# Responding to an Objection form (CS4243)

Use this form if we have previously notified you that the other parent or carer in your child support case has submitted an objection to a decision.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Responding to an Objection form](/sites/default/files/2024-10/cs4243-2410en-f.pdf "PDF document").

Use this form to either agree or disagree with their objection.
