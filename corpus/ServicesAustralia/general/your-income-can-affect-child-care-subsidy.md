## Family income

We’ll work out your Child Care Subsidy (CCS) percentage using [your family income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=41186).

Your CCS percentage applies to either your [hourly fee](/type-child-care-you-use-can-affect-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#hourlyfee) or the relevant [hourly rate cap](/type-child-care-you-use-can-affect-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#hourlyrate), whichever is lower.

We pay this directly to your child care service to reduce the fees you pay.

Use the [Child Care Subsidy calculator](https://www.startingblocks.gov.au/child-care-subsidy-calculator) on the Starting Blocks website to see what you may be eligible for.

### Standard CCS rates

Your family income

Child Care Subsidy percentage

$0 to $85,279

90%

More than $85,279 to below $535,279

Between 90% and 0%  
The percentage goes down by 1% for every $5,000 of income your family earns above $85,279

$535,279 or more

0%

If you have more than one child aged 5 or younger, you may get a [higher rate](/your-number-children-care-can-affect-your-higher-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#who) for one or more of your children.

You can claim CCS even if your family income estimate is $535,279 or more. If you have claimed CCS and you earn less than this, we’ll pay you the subsidy you’re entitled to. We’ll do this when we [balance your payments](/balancing-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) at the end of the financial year.

Watch this video to learn more about Child Care Subsidy and your family income estimate.

## Withholding

We’ll withhold 5% of your subsidy each fortnight to reduce your chances of an overpayment. If you’re overpaid, you may get a debt when we balance your payments.

You can change this amount to suit your circumstances online.You can do this twice a year. If you’d like to change it more than this, call the [Families line](#toolbar-phone).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now and select **View withholdings** to manage your withholdings.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services/ccs-summary)

We use your family income estimate to work out how much subsidy you’ll get. This means at the end of each financial year we’ll [balance your payment](/balancing-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) using your [actual adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=41186). We compare this information to make sure we’ve subsidised your child care fees correctly in the financial year.

If you underestimated your family income, you may end up with an overpayment which you’ll need to pay back. We’ll use the amount we withheld to help reduce the debt.

If you have a CCS [overpayment](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments), we may use some of your CCS each fortnight to pay this back.

If you don’t get CCS each fortnight, the easiest way to repay money is online using the **Money you owe** service. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to do this.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you overestimated your family income and didn’t get enough subsidy, we’ll pay any outstanding amount directly to you. This will include the amount we withheld.
