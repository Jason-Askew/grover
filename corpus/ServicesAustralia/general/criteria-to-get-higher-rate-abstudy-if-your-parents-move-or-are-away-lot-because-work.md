# Your parents move or are away a lot because of work

You may get a higher rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance if your parents move a lot for work. You must also live away from home to study because of this.

They must also meet 1 of the following:

-   they need to be away from home at least 40 week nights in the school year for work
-   they don’t normally live in one place during the school week because they do regular or long travel for work.
