# Income and assets form (SA369)

Use this form if you’re claiming a payment and need to tell us about your income and assets.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Income and assets form](/sites/default/files/2024-11/sa369-2412en-f.pdf "PDF document").

Complete this form and the relevant claim form if you want to claim any of the following payments:

-   [Age Pension](/age-pension)
-   [Disability Support Payment](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Farm Household Allowance](/farm-household-allowance).

We’ll use this information to work out your payment, as well as your partner’s payment.
