## How to enrol

You can enrol in Medicare either:

-   online through myGov
-   by completing a Medicare enrolment form.

### Enrolling online

Some people can enrol online as either an individual or a family through myGov and track the progress.

To enrol online you and your family members need to:

-   live in Australia
-   have a current passport or ImmiCard
-   have valid visa details from the Department of Home Affairs if you’re not an Australian citizen.

If you want to enrol as a family, we need details and identity documents for any children under 15.

If you want to include someone 15 or older, you need to give that person your myGov online application number.

They need the number to give us their details and identity documents through their own myGov account to complete their Medicare enrolment.

If you have a myGov account sign in and enrol in Medicare now. If you don’t have a myGov account you need to [create one](/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://my.gov.au/)

If your application is approved, we’ll contact you with your next steps. We’ll also send you your [Medicare card](/your-medicare-card?context=60092) in the mail to the address you gave us.

### Extending Medicare eligibility

If you and your family’s Medicare eligibility is about to expire you may be able to extend it online. Learn more about [extending Medicare eligibility](/enrolling-medicare?context=60092#extendingmedicareeligibility).

### Enrolling with a form

If you can’t enrol or extend online, complete a [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). You can mail or email it with your supporting documents to [Medicare Enrolment Services](/write-to-us#medicare).

If you email us, include ‘Medicare enrolment’ in the email subject line.

Make sure your documents are:

-   in PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format
-   not password protected, or in a WinZip or RAR file
-   no larger than 5MB for each document
-   no larger than 10MB in total for all the documents.
