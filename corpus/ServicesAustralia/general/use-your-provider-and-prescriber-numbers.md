## Medicare provider numbers

You’ll need your unique provider number to:

-   claim
-   bill
-   refer or request Medicare services.

You can get a Medicare provider number if you’re an [eligible health professional](/eligibility-for-health-professionals?context=20).

You must first have a registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) or an approved body.

We’ll record your name against your provider number exactly as it’s registered with the relevant registration board or professional body.

You can’t use another health professional’s provider number.

You’ll need more than one Medicare provider number if you:

-   deliver health services in different locations
-   have registrations in more than one health profession
-   are a health professional providing Medicare Urgent Care Clinic (UCC) services
-   are a health professional working in the reserve of general practitioner respiratory practices.

Find out how to [apply for additional provider numbers](/apply-for-additional-provider-numbers?context=20) if you work:

-   in a new practice location
-   work at a new service at the same location
-   health profession or discipline.

## PBS prescriber numbers

You’ll need more than one prescriber number if you provide services in multiple health professions.

A prescriber number is a 7-digit number that:

-   uniquely identifies you’re eligible to prescribe medication under the PBS
-   isn’t location specific.
