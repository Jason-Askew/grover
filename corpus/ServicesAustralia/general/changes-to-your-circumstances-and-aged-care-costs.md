# Changes to your circumstances and aged care costs

We need to know about changes to your circumstances within 28 days of the change occurring.

It’s important to keep your personal and financial details up to date. This is because changes to your circumstances can change how much you contribute towards your aged care costs.

When you [update your details](/update-your-details-if-you-get-help-with-aged-care-cost-care?context=23296), we’ll review how much you pay if:

-   you’ve told us about changes to your personal and financial details
-   your aged care provider has told us about changes to your care.

When we do this, we’ll:

-   work out how much you’ll pay
-   check if adjustments are needed
-   write to you and your aged care provider to tell you if there are changes to your aged care costs.

If you’re receiving ongoing care at home and the amount you’re asked to contribute has increased, the new amount will apply from the start of the next quarter.

If you’re receiving care in an aged care home and the amount you’re asked to contribute has increased, the new amount may be applied from either the date we review your aged care costs or the date you notified us of the change.

You can ask for a review at any time by calling either the:

-   [Aged Care line](#toolbar-phone)
-   [Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) general enquiries line](https://www.dva.gov.au/contact).
