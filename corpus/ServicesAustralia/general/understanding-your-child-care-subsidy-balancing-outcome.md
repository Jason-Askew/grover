# Understanding your Child Care Subsidy balancing outcome

Once we’ve balanced your Child Care Subsidy (CCS), we’ll let you know the outcome in writing.

## on this page

-   [Top ups](#topups)
-   [Outstanding debts](#outstandingdebts)
-   [If you need to pay back money you owe](#moneyyouowe)

You’ll get a letter explaining the outcome through your [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) Inbox or delivered to your postal address.

Your CCS balancing outcome will be one of the following:

-   a top up, where we owe you money
-   an outstanding debt, where you may need to pay money back
-   no change, where you got the right amount of CCS.

## Top ups

We may not have paid you enough CCS during the year. If this happens, you may get any outstanding amounts when we balance your payments. This includes any [CCS withholdings](/your-income-can-affect-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#withholdingccs). We call this a top up.

If you have any existing Child Care Benefit (CCB), Child Care Rebate (CCR) or CCS debts, your top up can be used to pay these back first. Any remaining amount will be paid directly to your nominated bank account.

## Outstanding debts

If we paid you too much CCS during the year or you have an outstanding debt with us, we may recover it from either your:

-   CCS top up and arrears payments
-   tax refund.

We can recover your debt from these payments even if you’ve entered into a repayment arrangement with us.

If your CCS is current we’ll start withholding 20% of your payments to repay the debt. This will occur even if you have another repayment plan in place.

Find out more about [how we recover debts at tax time](/how-we-recover-debts-tax-time).

## If you need to pay back money you owe

You can check your Centrelink debts online. Select **Money You Owe** from either your:

-   [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

You can change or [pause your debt repayments](/disaster-events-where-you-have-flexible-debt-repayment-choices), if you’re affected by a current disaster event in your state or territory.

If you disagree with a decision we’ve made, you have the right to ask us to review it. Find out more about [explanations and formal reviews](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).

It’s important you talk to us if you’re experiencing financial hardship or worried about paying back a debt. We can work with you to set up a repayment plan you can afford.
