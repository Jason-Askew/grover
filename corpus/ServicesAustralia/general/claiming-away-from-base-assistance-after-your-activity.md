# Claiming Away from Base Assistance after your activity

You can pay for your meals and accommodation to attend an activity and ask us for reimbursement.

To apply for a reimbursement, you’ll need to give us a statement from the education provider. The statement will need to include the following information:

-   details of the activity including where it took place and the dates you attended
-   the activity was a compulsory part of the course
-   the relevance of the activity to the course
-   confirmation the work completed during the activity contributed to the course assessment.

You'll need to lodge your claim by 1 April of the year following the activity.

If you arranged your own travel, you can also claim [ABSTUDY Fares Allowance](/how-to-claim-abstudy-fares-allowance). You’ll need to claim this by 31 March of the year following the activity. This is so we can reimburse your travel costs.

## Who we pay

If your education provider organises a residential expenses package, we’ll pay 1 of the following:

-   your education provider
-   the organisation incurring the cost.

If you claim ABSTUDY Fares Allowance as a reimbursement, we’ll pay 1 of the following:

-   you, if you paid for the travel
-   education provider, if they paid for the travel
-   other organisation, if they paid for the travel.

If you lodge a claim for a daily allowance, we’ll pay you.

If you need help, call the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).
