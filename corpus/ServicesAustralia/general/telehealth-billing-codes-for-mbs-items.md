# MBS telehealth items

There are specific Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) telehealth items for health professionals to use.

## on this page

-   [GP Chronic Condition Management plans](#a1)
-   [Telehealth chronic condition management services](#a2)
-   [Mental Health Treatment Plans](#a3)
-   [Eating disorder treatment and management plans](#a4)
-   [Complex Neurodevelopmental Conditions and eligible disabilities](#a5)
-   [In-patient psychiatry services](#a6)
-   [Practice nurses](#a7)
-   [Participating midwives](#a8)
-   [Nurse practitioners](#a9)
-   [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care professionals](#a10)

MBS telehealth (video and phone) items are permanent and available nationally.

Find out more about the relevant item descriptions, fact sheets and explanatory notes for [MBS telehealth services](https://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/Factsheet-Telehealth-Updates-April%202023) on the MBS Online website.

MBS telehealth items have the same clinical requirements as the corresponding face-to-face items and have the same MBS benefit.

Video services are the preferred approach for substituting a face-to-face service. You can provide some services by phone where clinically appropriate. Video and phone services have different MBS item numbers.

You can’t claim MBS telehealth items for services provided to admitted hospital and hospital in-the-home patients, except for some psychiatry MBS telehealth items.

MBS telehealth items can’t be used for email consultations.

[Contact us](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#medicareprovider) for Medicare provider enquiries.

## GP Chronic Condition Management plans

GP chronic condition management plan (GPCCMP) items are for General Practitioners (GP) and Prescribed Medical Practitioners (PMP) to plan and coordinate the health care of patients with chronic or terminal medical conditions.

You can use these items if you’re working in general practice and are either the patient’s usual medical practitioner or a GP or PMP at the general practice they are enrolled in for MyMedicare.
