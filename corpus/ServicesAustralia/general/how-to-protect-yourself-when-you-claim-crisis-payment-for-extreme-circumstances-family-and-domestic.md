When you claim a payment, the claim details appear in your online account as Crisis Payment for Extreme Circumstances. We’ll also contact you in writing about the claim.

If other people have access to your online account, they can see this information. If you’re in this situation, it may not be safe to claim online. You may need to change some details before you claim, or claim in a different way. If you aren’t sure, [call us](/phone-us) on your regular payment line and ask to speak with a social worker. They’ll help you submit your claim safely.
