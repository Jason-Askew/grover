If you get an email or text message about the robodebt class action, make sure it’s real.

We’re sending registration notices to eligible group members of the new robodebt class action settlement. You’ll get the notice in your myGov inbox or in the mail.

You can check your myGov inbox by entering my.gov.au in a website browser or by using the official myGov app.

We may also send an email or text message notifying you about the class action registration.

We’ll never include a link in an email or text message. We also won’t ask you to click on an attachment or download a webform.

If you have questions about the class action, whether you’re eligible and how to register, read more on the [Group Member Registration and Information Portal](https://www.robodebtsettlement.com.au/) on Gordon Legal’s class action settlement website.
