# Helping you transition off

When you stop getting Farm Household Allowance (FHA) you may be able to get other payments or support services.

There are a number of reasons why you may be about to transition off FHA, including you:

-   are in a [better financial situation](/better-financial-situation?context=22161)
-   have [received the maximum period of payment](/received-maximum-period-farm-household-allowance?context=22161)
-   are [no longer farming or are preparing for retirement](/no-longer-farming-and-getting-farm-household-allowance?context=22161)
-   have had [your circumstances change](/your-circumstances-have-changed-when-transitioning-fha?context=22161).

Also on this page, you can read about [other payments and services](/help-with-other-payments-and-services-you-transition-fha?context=22161).

When you stop getting FHA, we’ll cancel your [Health Care Card](/health-care-card).
