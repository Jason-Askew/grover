# There are payments to support you if you’re retraining or studying

Published: 12 February 2026

If you stop looking for work to start retraining or study, you may be eligible for other payments from us.

If you transition from looking for work to retrain or start studying, there are payments you could get from us. The payment you could get depends on your circumstances.

If you’re studying an approved course, you could get one of the following:

-   Youth Allowance if you’re 24 or younger
-   Austudy if you’re 25 or older
-   ABSTUDY if you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait islander.

You’ll need to meet some rules. You may also be able to get extra payments, such as the Pensioner Education Supplement or the Education Entry payment.
