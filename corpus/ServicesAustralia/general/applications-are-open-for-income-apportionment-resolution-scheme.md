If you have debts affected by income apportionment, you can apply for a one-off payment for each eligible debt.

The Income Apportionment Resolution Scheme provides compensation for people with debts affected by income apportionment.

Before December 2020, we commonly used income apportionment to help us work out how much people should have been paid.

Resolution Scheme payments will be one-off payments for each eligible debt you have.

The amount you’re eligible to receive depends on the value of your debt.

Applications for the Resolution Scheme are now open and close on 29 January 2027.
