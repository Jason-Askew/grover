Changes to the care arrangements for your child can affect your child support assessment. You need to tell us about changes straight away. If you don’t tell us within 28 days any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.

Any changes can also affect other payments like Family Tax Benefit.
