# What a Disability Medical Assessment is

A Disability Medical Assessment (DMA) helps us decide if you meet the medical rules for Disability Support Pension.

A DMA occurs after a Job Capacity Assessment.

A Government-contracted Doctor from Sonic HealthPlus will conduct the assessment. They will be a qualified Medical Practitioner or a Clinical Psychologist.

You should allow up to an hour for your assessment, however it may take less time than this. You don’t have to pay for this assessment.

## Your assessment

### Book your assessment

If you need to attend an assessment, Sonic HealthPlus will contact you by phone. They may send you an SMS before they call. If they can’t reach you by phone, they may send you a letter asking you to call them.

During the phone call, they’ll book your assessment. If you require an interpreter, they may call you with an interpreter to assist with booking your assessment. An interpreter can also be booked to help you at your assessment.

Let them know if you prefer a Government-contracted Doctor of a particular gender to undertake your assessment.

### Attend your assessment

Sonic HealthPlus will speak to you about what options are available for you to attend an appointment with a Government-contracted Doctor. Your assessment will be done either in person, by videoconference, or in some cases by phone. Where required the assessment may also be done directly with your Treating Health Professional.

The Government-contracted Doctor will keep your personal information safe. They must protect [your right to privacy](/your-right-to-privacy).
