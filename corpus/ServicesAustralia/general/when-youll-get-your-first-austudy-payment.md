# When you’ll get your first payment

There may be one or more waiting periods that apply before you get your first Austudy payment.

-   [Why you may have to wait](#a2)

## When you’ll get paid

If you don’t have a waiting period, you’ll get your first Austudy payment 2 weeks after we grant your payment. Then each fortnight after that.

We calculate the waiting periods that apply to you when we assess your claim. If you don’t have a waiting period, you’ll get your first payment within 2 weeks, if your claim is successful.

You can expect to hear from us within 42 days of submitting your [claim](/how-to-claim-austudy?context=22441). We’ll give you an estimated completion date when you submit your claim online.

We often process claims before the date we estimate. However, in busy times like before semester one, claims can take longer to process.

The time it takes us to assess your claim doesn’t affect your waiting period.

## Why you may have to wait

There are different reasons you may need to wait, depending on your situation.

### You have savings or other money

You may have to wait 1 to 13 weeks if you or your partner have liquid assets over certain limits. Liquid assets are any funds readily available to you or your partner. This includes money owed by your or your partner’s employer.

Read about [liquid assets waiting periods](/liquid-assets-waiting-period?context=22441).

### You got a lump sum payment when you finished work

You may have to wait if your employer paid you a lump sum as either:

-   annual leave
-   a redundancy when you left.

The time you have to wait is relative to the lump sum payment. Read about [income maintenance periods](/income-maintenance-period?context=22441).

### You’ve had a compensation payment

You may have to wait if you’ve had a lump sum compensation payment. The time you have to wait is relative to your lump sum payment. Use our [estimator](/when-to-use-centrelink-compensation-estimator?context=22516) or [contact us](/contact-us) for information about your compensation preclusion period.

### You recently finished seasonal work

You may have to wait if you or your partner finished seasonal, contract or intermittent work in the 6 months before claiming.

The time you need to wait depends on how much you earned and how long you were working. Read about [seasonal work preclusion periods](/seasonal-work-preclusion-period?context=22441).

### You’re new to Australia

If you've recently arrived in Australia as a resident, you may have to wait up to 4 years to qualify. Read about the [newly arrived resident’s waiting period](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22441).
