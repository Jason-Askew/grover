# Re-entering the workforce

Getting back to work after a long break can be challenging. Here are tips and resources to help you get back into the workforce.

It can take time to find the right job, so be patient, consider your goals and limitations, and be flexible.

## Know your skills

You may feel your skills are out of date and you’ve lost touch with the industry. But you already have skills to offer. You may just need help selling them to employers.

If you’re not sure what your career strengths are, the [myfuture](http://www.myfuture.edu.au/) website may be helpful. It can help you plan your career pathway and manage your transition into a new career.

The [Jobs and Skills Atlas](https://www.jobsandskills.gov.au/jobs-and-skills-atlas) on the Jobs and Skills Australia website gives an overview of the Australian job market at national, state and regional level.

### Retraining, studying or upskilling

We can support you if you choose to:

-   start an apprenticeship or traineeship
-   retrain in a new industry.

Read more about [retraining](/retraining) and the help that’s available.

### Skills for education and employment (SEE)

If you’re 15 or over and have left school, you may be able to get a payment if you do a SEE course.

SEE courses offer free training to improve your reading, writing, maths and computer skills to help you find work or study.

Find out more about the [SEE program](https://www.dewr.gov.au/skills-education-and-employment/participants) on the Department of Employment & Workplace Relations website.

### Parent Pathways

Parent Pathways is a voluntary support service for parents and carers of children aged under 6 that can help you identify and achieve your future goals. The service is flexible and tailored to your individual circumstances.

You’ll work with a mentor who will support you during your time with Parent Pathways. You’ll also get tailored advice, guidance and resources in a supportive and safe environment, where your children are always welcome.

Find out more about [Parent Pathways](/parent-pathways).

## Tailor your application

Tailor your resume for each job you apply for. This can make you stand out from others who apply.

Visit the [Workforce Australia](https://workforceaustralia.gov.au/) website and learn how to write a resume and cover letter.

If you have a Workforce Australia provider, they can also help you:

-   write a resume
-   prepare for interviews
-   get skills that local employers need.

Another resource is the [Job Jumpstart](http://www.jobjumpstart.gov.au) website. It has practical tips on tailoring job searches to employers you want to work for.

## Work-life balance

Making sure you balance your new job and personal life can make re-entering the workforce easier.

Most employers will consider flexible work arrangements if you have caring responsibilities. You’ll need to talk to them about the working hours and conditions you need.

We can help cover the cost of approved child care through [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy).

If you’re moving from income support into a job, you may be eligible for either:

-   [Additional Child Care Subsidy](/additional-child-care-subsidy)
-   [Additional Child Care Subsidy Transition to Work](/transition-to-work-additional-child-care-subsidy).

These give some families extra help with child care fees.

We pay these subsidies to your child care provider to reduce the fees you pay.
