# Manage budget changes

Your budget may change depending on how much you earn. We have tools and support to help you manage your money.

-   [Help with money](#a1)
-   [Help if you’re self-employed](#a2)

You’ll go through many changes in your lifetime, so the way you use your money will change. We have information to help you [manage your money](/manage-your-money) at different times of your life. You can use this [simple money manager](/how-to-budget#simplemoney) to keep track of your finances.

## Help with money

If the hours you work and how much you earn often change, we may be able to help you.

### Advance payments

Depending on what payment you get from us, you may be able to get an [advance payment](/advance-payment).

This means you can get a payment early. You pay it back later out of your payments from us.

There’s a limit on how much money we can advance you. The amount depends on what kind of payment you get.

### Weekly payments

The [weekly payment option](/weekly-payment-option) allows you to get your income support payment weekly. This can help you better budget expenses.

### Other help available

Our [Financial Information Service (FIS) Officers](/financial-information-service-officers) can talk to you about financial matters and can help you make informed financial decisions. As a free service, FIS Officers are available to assist through a dedicated phone service, video and face-to-face appointments.
