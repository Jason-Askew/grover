## Payment correspondence

We’ll send payment correspondence to approved suppliers through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) message. You can also access them in your Statement and Subscriptions.

These include all of the following:

-   a payment advice with details about payments we made to your bank account
-   a deduction statement detailing any fees we’ve charged for manual claims
-   a recipient created tax invoice (RCTI) for payments that include goods and services tax (GST).

To get your payment correspondence electronically you need to [subscribe to statements, notifications and payment information](/use-hpos-messages?context=20) in HPOS.

Your organisation is automatically subscribed to get statements through HPOS when it’s registered for PBS.

Remember to check your members have the right HPOS attributes in Provider Digital Access (PRODA) to act on your organisation’s behalf.

## PBS reconciliation statement

There are 2 types of PBS reconciliation statements you can get through your prescription dispensing software:

-   weekly interim reconciliation statements
-   final PBS reconciliation statements when each claim period closes.

Final PBS statements help you reconcile your online claims with the prescription details in your software.

These statements have details about the claim period, broken down into the following sections.

### Prescription summary and adjustments

Shows an overview of all prescriptions you processed or adjusted in the claim period, since the previous statement.

### The prescription details

Shows each prescription you submitted during the claim period. The table lists each prescription and price if it was accepted as well as any associated reason codes.

### PBS entitlement errors

Shows a table of each prescription with an entitlement error. It lists rejections, warnings and details of any errors.

### Explanation of reason codes

Shows any reason codes your software returned for prescriptions you claimed during the relevant period. Your software gives you reason codes and explains warnings or rejected prescriptions.
