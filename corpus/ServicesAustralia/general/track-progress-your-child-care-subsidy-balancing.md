# Track the progress of your CCS balancing

You can track your Child Care Subsidy (CCS) balancing online.

## on this page

-   [Use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](#a1)
-   [Use your Centrelink online account](#a2)

## Use the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app

Open the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

Select **More**, followed by **Child Care Subsidy** then **Payment Balancing** from the menu.

If you haven’t confirmed your income by lodging a tax return or telling us you don’t need to lodge one, you’ll see the message, **We don’t have all the information to start balancing your payments**. It will also tell you who hasn’t confirmed their income.

Once we get your income, you’ll see the message, **We haven’t finished balancing your payments yet. We have all the information we need and will balance your payments as soon as we can**.

Your result will display once your balancing is complete.

## Use your Centrelink online account

You can also check using your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/).

Select **Menu**, followed by **My family**, then **Child Care**. From there you’ll be able to select **Payment Balancing** for more information.
