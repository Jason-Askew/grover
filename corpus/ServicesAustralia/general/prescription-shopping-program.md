# Prescription Shopping Program

The Prescription Shopping Program (PSP) helps you make informed decisions for your patient.

Register for the Prescription Shopping Information Service (PSIS)

Before you can use the PSIS, [call us](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#prescriptionshopping) to register.

Prescription Shopping Information Service (PSIS)

[Call the PSIS](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#prescriptionshopping) to find out if your patient meets the Prescription Shopping Program (PSP) criteria.

It’s available 24 hours, 7 days a week for PBS medical prescribers. All other PBS prescribers can access the service Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm AEST.

When you call the PSIS we’ll ask for:

-   your prescriber number
-   your full name
-   a security question about your identity
-   the patient’s Medicare number, full name and date of birth.

If your patient meets the criteria, we’ll give you a summary of the PBS items supplied to them. This information is accurate up to the last 24 hours.

We can also send you a PSP Patient Summary Report (PSR). The report is a list of PBS medicines supplied to your patient in a 3-month period.

You can use this information to talk to your patient about medication and their prescriptions.

If they do not meet the criteria, we will advise you of this but will not provide any additional information.

If you’re worried about your patient, you can contact the health department in your state or territory. You can ask about statutory reporting requirements or other programs to help you manage your patient.

Prescription Shopping Program Patient Summary Reports (PSP PSR)

A PSP PSR can be made available in [Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)](/hpos?context=20) for 14 days from when you call PSIS.

You need a [Provider Digital Access (PRODA)](/what-services-you-can-access-with-proda) account to access [HPOS](/hpos?context=20). If you don’t have one, [register for PRODA online](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

To view the PSR follow these steps:

1.  Log in to your PRODA account to access HPOS.
2.  Select **My Programs**.
3.  Select **Prescription Shopping Patient Summary Reports**.
4.  Select **View** next to the report you want to see.

Prescription Shopping Alert Service (PSAS)

PSP criteria

Patients meet the PSP criteria if they get any of the following within a 3-month period:

-   Any PBS items prescribed by 6 or more different prescribers.
-   A total of 25 or more PBS target items.
-   A total of 50 or more target or non-target PBS items.

We use PBS data to know when a patient gets PBS medicine from an approved pharmacy. The data can take up to 24 hours to update.

What we can’t tell you

We run the PSP based on privacy and legal guidelines. We can’t tell you the PBS medicines supplied to someone who isn’t your patient.

We also can’t tell you the PBS medicines supplied to your patient if:

-   they used over-the-counter medicine
-   a prescriber gave them samples of medication or any emergency treatment
-   a pharmacist gave them PBS medicine in an emergency
-   medicine was prescribed to them under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS)
-   medicine was supplied to them as a private prescription or as a PBS Section 100 item.
