If your circumstances change without much notice, it’s best to start your claim as soon as possible.

You may be eligible for payment from the day your circumstances change if both apply:

-   you submit an early claim within the 14 days before your change of circumstances
-   we assess that you meet eligibility requirements.

In most cases, if you submit your claim after your circumstances change, you may be eligible for payment from the date of your claim. We’ll need to assess that you meet eligibility requirements.

You may need to serve any waiting periods that apply to you.

You can only get the payment after we assess and grant it.
