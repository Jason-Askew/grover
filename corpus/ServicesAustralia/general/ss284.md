# Relationship details form (SS284)

Use this form to provide us details of your living arrangements. This is so we can assess whether to pay you as a single person or as a member of a couple.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

You and the person you share accommodation with each need to complete a form.

If it puts you at risk, they don’t need to complete this form.

Download and complete the [Relationship details form](/sites/default/files/2025-08/ss284-2508en-f.pdf "PDF document").

You can send the link of the form to the person you share accommodation with. They need to return their completed form to you, so you can submit it with yours.
