# Enrolling your baby in Medicare

You can enrol your baby when you claim some family payments or by using a form.

## on this page

-   [If you claim a Centrelink family payment](#a1)
-   [If you don’t claim a Centrelink family payment](#a2)
-   [If you don’t have a Newborn Child Declaration form](#a3)

You need to enrol your newborn baby in Medicare as soon as possible. A newborn is a child aged up to 52 weeks or up to their first birthday.

Your hospital or midwife will give you a Parent Pack after the birth. It’ll include a Newborn Child Declaration form. A doctor or midwife must sign the form on the last page. Use this declaration as proof of your child’s birth to enrol them in Medicare.

If you lose your Newborn Child Declaration form, you’ll need your child’s birth certificate to enrol them to Medicare.

If your child is over 52 weeks old, you’ll need your child’s birth certificate. You can mail or email your [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004) to [Medicare Enrolment Services](/write-to-us#medicareenrolmentservices) with your supporting documents.

You don’t need to get your supporting documents certified.

Read more about the supporting documents you need to [enrol in Medicare](/enrolling-medicare?context=60092).

## If you claim a Centrelink family payment

You can enrol your baby online when you claim any of these family payments:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) including [Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement)
-   [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay).

Use your completed Newborn Child Declaration form in your claim. It’s in the Parent Pack your hospital or midwife gives you.

If your Centrelink account is linked to myGov, sign in now to submit a copy of the form.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also do this using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

We’ll enrol your baby and add them to your Medicare card. We’ll also add them to the [Australian Immunisation Register](/australian-immunisation-register).

We’ll send you a new Medicare card with your baby on it. You should get it in 3 to 4 weeks.

You can also use the Newborn Child Declaration form to register your baby for both:

-   the [Medicare Safety Net](/medicare-safety-nets).

Keep in mind, you can add your baby to another Medicare card. This means you can add your baby to the Medicare card for both parents. You can only list them on 2 cards. To do this, complete an [Application to copy or transfer from one Medicare card to another form](/ms011).
