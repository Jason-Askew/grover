-   [Who gets it once only](#getsitonceonly)
-   [Who gets it once every rolling 12 months](#rolling12months)
-   [Who gets it once each calendar year as a recurring payment](#onceayear)

Depending on the payment you get that makes you eligible for EdEP, you may get it in one of the following ways:

-   once only
-   once every rolling 12 months
-   once each calendar year as a recurring payment.

EdEP is a taxable Centrelink payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=22146).

## Who gets it once only

You may get EdEP once at the start of your course if you’re transferring to one of the following student payments:

-   [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices) for students
-   [ABSTUDY](/abstudy-living-allowance)
-   [Austudy](/austudy).

Learn more about [who can get EdEP when transferring](/who-can-get-education-entry-payment?context=22146#transferring).

## Who gets it once every rolling 12 months

You’ll get EdEP when you start your course if you get a [payment with a 12 month requirement](/who-can-get-education-entry-payment?context=22146#12monthrequirement). This could be either:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) partnered.

If you continue studying, you may get EdEP again 12 months after your last payment. You may need to call us on your regular payment line to check if you’re still eligible.

## Who gets it once each calendar year as a recurring payment

If you get Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) and a [payment with no time requirement](/who-can-get-education-entry-payment?context=22146#notimerequirement), you’ll get EdEP both:

-   with your first PES payment
-   in January each year following your first payment, if you keep studying.

This applies to people who get PES while getting one of the following payments:

-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) single
-   [Special Benefit](/special-benefit) in some situations.

### Example

Ali gets Carer Payment and has enrolled in 2 year Advanced Diploma in Industrial Automation. Ali starts the course in March and applies for PES. She gets EdEP with her first PES payment and then again in January of the following year as she keeps studying.
