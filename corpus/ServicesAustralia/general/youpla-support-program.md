# Youpla Support Program

Since 1 July 2024, the Australian Government has provided resolution payments through the Youpla Support Program.

The National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA) will assess your eligibility for a resolution payment through the Youpla support program. They’ll share your information with us.

## How payments are worked out

The Government will figure out your resolution payment using the information collected by Youpla Group and assessed by the NIAA.

We will match the information provided by the NIAA about you with the information in your Centrelink record.

If you are eligible, we will then use information in your Centrelink record to contact you to discuss the resolution payment.

Further information about eligibility for the Youpla Support Program is available on the [NIAA’s Youpla Support Program](https://www.niaa.gov.au/indigenous-affairs/grants-and-funding/youpla-support-program) webpage.

## What happens next

Our staff will call eligible former Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) and Youpla members with more information about the Youpla Support Program.

As part of this call, we may offer you a referral for financial counselling with [Mob Strong](https://financialrights.org.au/getting-help/mob-strong-debt-help/), part of the Financial Rights Legal Centre.

## What you need to do

Most eligible people have now got their payment. However, there are still a few former Youpla members we haven’t contacted yet.

If you think this could be you, please call the [Centrelink Indigenous call centre](#toolbar-phone). You can also [visit your local service centre](/find-us).

## How to contact us
