## Managing personnel

Personnel are individual employees from your business with access to services in Business Hub.

All personnel must have their own [individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account?context=33786). Personnel may act on behalf of multiple businesses from their individual PRODA account.

Your business will need to identify at least one access manager in Business Hub. This person is responsible for managing who in your business has access to services in Business Hub.

If you need access to Business Hub services, talk to your access manager. You’ll need to give them your verified PRODA Registration Authority (RA) number.

If your business transitions from Centrelink Business Online Services you may not have an access manager. If so, your business will need to [contact us](/business-and-employer-contact-information).

A Business Hub access manager can:

-   add or remove personnel
-   add and remove roles that determine what services personnel can use on behalf of the business
-   manage their own access to services
-   assign the access manager role to other authorised representatives of the business.
