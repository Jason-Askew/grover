## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with daratumumab under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 for patients with newly diagnosed systemic light chain amyloidosis.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing daratumumab.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with daratumumab, patients must be treated by a haematologist (this does not exclude treatment via a multidisciplinary team, but the PBS authority application must be written by the treating haematologist).
