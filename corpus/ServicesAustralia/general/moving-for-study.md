## Payments you can get

If you’re studying, training or doing an Australian Apprenticeship, you may get one of the following fortnightly payments:

-   [Youth Allowance for students and apprentices](/youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices), if you’re 24 or younger
-   [Austudy](/austudy), if you’re 25 or older
-   [ABSTUDY](/abstudy), if you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian.

If you need to move to start or continue studying, you may be eligible for other payments.

[Tertiary Access Payment](/tertiary-access-payment) helps with the cost of moving from a regional or remote area for tertiary study. You can only claim this payment in your first year of tertiary study. You can apply for it even if you don’t get other payments from us.

[Fares Allowance](/fares-allowance) helps with travel costs between your permanent home and place of tertiary study. To be eligible, you must get certain payments from us.

[ABSTUDY Fares Allowance](/abstudy-fares-allowance) helps with travel costs between your permanent home and place of study. You can get it if you get ABSTUDY and need to live away from home to study.

[Relocation Scholarship](/relocation-scholarship?context=60023) helps if you move to or from a regional or remote area for higher education. It’s a once a year payment. You must be getting Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY.

[Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance?context=60023) is an automatic payment if you pay rent and get certain payments from us. We’ll check you can get this payment when you claim a payment from us.

## Help managing your payments

If you get a payment from us, it’s important you [update your address](/changing-your-address-if-youre-moving-house?context=60023#a1) if it changes.

If you’re changing address to start study, you need to tell us where you’ll be living while studying as soon as possible. This is so we can make sure you get the right payment and amount.

If you’re dependent you must tell us if your family home address changes. You need to do this even if you’re living away from your family home. To find out if you’re dependent, read about your student payment:

-   [Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices](/dependent-or-independent-for-youth-allowance-student-or-australian-apprentice)
-   [ABSTUDY](/dependent-or-independent-for-abstudy?context=45541).
