# Explaining the decision

After we assess your claim for Disability Support Pension (DSP), we’ll tell you the outcome and explain our decision.

## on this page

-   [When you can get DSP](#a1)
-   [When you can’t get DSP](#a2)

When you submit a complete claim with medical evidence, we’ll assess if you meet both the:

-   [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   [medical rules](/medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

We assess if you can get DSP and let you know the result of your claim. We'll send a letter to explain our decision to your preferred type of communication. This could be one of the following:

-   [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online)
-   [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account)
-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   a letter in the mail.

## When you can get DSP

If we accept your claim, we’ll send you a letter to let you know. We’ll pay you DSP from the date noted in the letter.

If you get DSP, you’ll need to meet your obligations to keep getting the payment. Read more about how to [manage your payment](/how-to-manage-your-payment-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

## When you can’t get DSP

If you don’t meet all the medical and non-medical rules we’ll reject your claim. If we reject your claim, we’ll try to call you to explain why. We’ll also write to you. You need to [keep your contact details](/self-service) up to date so we can contact you.

One of our Service Officers will call you to explain:

-   the reason for our decision
-   your options if you don’t agree with our decision.

If you are still unsure, you can contact us to ask for more information about our assessment, including:

-   a copy of your medical assessment
-   why you don’t meet DSP eligibility.

If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).

An advocate can support you while you’re seeking help, claiming a payment from us, and can also attend appointments with you. Read about [someone to act for you](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=22276).

You can also read about [Disability Representative Organisations](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-advocacy/disability-representative-organisations) on the Department of Social Services website. To find advocacy services in your area, you can use the [Ask Izzy - Disability Advocacy Finder](https://askizzy.org.au/disability-advocacy-finder) from the Department of Social Services, to search for advocacy providers using your suburb or postcode.

You may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276), if you can’t get DSP. We’ll discuss what else you may be able to claim.

We may also refer you for an [Employment Services Assessment](/employment-services-assessments?context=22276). This assessment is not about your DSP claim. This assessment will help us to understand your barriers to work and what employment services might help you.

We can also provide referrals to other services such as [Inclusive Employment Australia](/inclusive-employment-australia?context=22276) if you’re eligible. Find out about [Inclusive Employment Australia](https://www.dss.gov.au/inclusive-employment-australia) on the Department of Social Services website.

If your situation changes, and you think you may now be eligible for DSP, you can submit a new claim. Read more about [who can get it](/who-can-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and what to do before [claiming DSP again](/claiming-again-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
