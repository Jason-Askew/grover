# When and how to tell us about your travel

When you get Disability Support Pension, you should always tell us if you’re leaving Australia. This includes when you’re going on a cruise into international waters.

-   [How to tell us about your travel](#a2)
-   [Other ways to tell us about your travel](#a3)

## When to tell us about your travel

Let us know at least 6 weeks before you plan to leave Australia.

This gives us time to arrange a [medical review](/medical-reviews-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) if needed. The review helps decide if you can get your payment while overseas for longer than 28 days in 12 months.

## How to tell us about your travel

The easiest way to tell us about your travel plans and provide supporting documents is online.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to do this. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

We may ask for supporting documents about your travel. If we do, you should give us your evidence supporting documents before you leave Australia. The documents you need to provide depend on your circumstances. If you don’t give us the evidence before you leave Australia, your payment may stop when you depart. If we’ve stopped your payment, we’ll reassess it once we get your supporting documents.

You can also use your online account to get information on how your travel could affect your payments and concession cards.

## Other ways to tell us about your travel

If you can’t use an online account, tell us your travel plans by either:

-   calling the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone)
-   going to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.

Contact numbers available on this page.
