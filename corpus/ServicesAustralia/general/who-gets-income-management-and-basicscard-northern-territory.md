# Who gets it

You can no longer start Income Management in the Northern Territory. However if you started it before 4 September 2023 you can continue on Income Management.

You can keep using your Income Management account and BasicsCard if any of these applied to you before 4 September 2023:

-   you are 15 to 24 years old and had certain payments for the last 3 to 6 months
-   you are between 25 and Age Pension age and had certain payments for the last 12 to 24 months
-   a social worker referred you or you are a vulnerable young person
-   you volunteered for Income Management
-   you were referred by a State or Territory Child Protection Authority before 4 September 2023
-   you were referred by an approved organisation.

If you have a payment nominee who is on Income Management, it may affect your payment.

If you are on Income Management, you can choose to move to enhanced Income Management with an [enhanced Income Management account with a SmartCard](/enhanced-income-management-and-smartcard).

If you choose not to move, you will stay on Income Management and can keep using your BasicsCard if you have one. But if your circumstances change, you might need to move to enhanced Income Management later.
