# Examples if you work

Understand how your Work Bonus balance affects your assessable income.

## on this page

-   [Your income is more than $300](#a1)
-   [Your income is less than $300](#a2)

We apply the Work Bonus to [Work Bonus eligible income](/types-income-we-apply-work-bonus-to?context=22561).

These examples don’t cover every situation.

## Your income is more than $300

Doug’s Work Bonus eligible income is $400 a fortnight. We’ll apply the $300 Work Bonus amount to his eligible income. This leaves Doug with $100 of assessable income.

If Doug’s Work Bonus balance is greater than $100 we’ll use that to reduce his eligible income to zero. This means Doug has no Work Bonus eligible income to assess for the income test this fortnight.

If Doug has no Work Bonus balance, we’ll apply the income test to the remaining $100 of his assessable income. Depending on Doug’s circumstances, we may reduce his pension this fortnight.

## Your income is less than $300

Nala started a short-term contract with an income of $200 a fortnight. Nala’s income is less than the available Work Bonus of $300 for the fortnight. We’ll apply $200 of the Work Bonus to her eligible income. This will mean that Nala’s contract income won’t reduce her payment in that fortnight. We’ll also increase Nala’s Work Bonus balance by $100.
