# Documents you need if you’re a permanent resident

You need to provide documents that prove your identity and residency.

You can enrol in Medicare if you have a permanent resident visa. You’ll need to give us both of the following:

-   a current passport or ImmiCard
-   proof of permanent residence from the Department of Home Affairs.

We need copies of these documents for each person you want to enrol. You don’t need to get your documents certified.

If you don’t have these documents, [tell us](/phone-us#medicaregeneral). We’ll talk to you about other options.

## When you live overseas after you enrol

If you live overseas for more than 12 months, you won’t be eligible for Medicare. You’ll need to enrol again when you return to Australia.

You need to give us:

-   a current passport for each person enrolling
-   2 documents dated within the last 6 months that prove you and your family now live in Australia.

### Proving you now live in Australia

You can prove you live in Australia by giving us either:

-   2 documents from Australia
-   one document from Australia and one from where you last lived overseas.
