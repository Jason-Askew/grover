# Zero tolerance for abuse

We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of customers and staff.

Services Australia supports people affected by financial abuse, coercive control, or technology facilitated abuse. These are forms of family and domestic violence.

Everyone must use our services and products in a lawful, respectful, and safe manner.

We will not tolerate misuse of Services Australia systems and services to deliberately cause harm or have power and control over other people.
