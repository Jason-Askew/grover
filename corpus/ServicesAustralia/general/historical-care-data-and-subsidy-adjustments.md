## Historical care data

You can access historical event data for each care recipient in your aged care service claims. This includes entry and leave events.

You may also see inconsistent information between a submitted event and the claim if a manual adjustment has been processed. Up-to-date information will always show in the claim. If you need these details, [contact us](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#agedcare).

## 2-year variation rule

You have a limit of 2 years after the end of a payment period to change an event through the portal. If you need to make changes after the 2-year period, you’ll need to submit a manual request by email. Send your request to the [aged care payments team](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#agedcare) with relevant supporting evidence.

When you send the email, write ‘2-Year Claim Variation Request’ in the subject line. You must include dates for any evidence you are using to support your variation request.

## Subsidy adjustment

Caps are reconciled as part of monthly claims processing. If the cap is reached in the month being processed, the care recipient and service are notified after the claim is finalised.

Any delays in lodgement also delay the subsidy adjustment for a care recipient who has reached their cap.

We adjust payments to the provider for the part of the month after the care recipient’s cap takes effect, where the subsidy adjustment hasn’t been made yet.
