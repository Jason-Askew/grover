## What you need to do before you book an appointment

To book an appointment you need to know your Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN). You can find out what a [CRN is, whether you have one, or how to get one](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn?context=64107#howtogetacrn). If you don’t have a CRN, we can still support you.

We’ll ask you what you want to discuss at the appointment. This will help us prepare.

## Prepare for your appointment

It’s important to prepare for your appointment ahead of time. You’ll need to prove your identity.

If you’ve booked a phone appointment

Check your phone’s settings to ensure it allows calls from unknown numbers.

When we call we’ll ask you some questions. You’ll need to correctly answer them to prove who you are. This is so we know who you are and that we have the right record.

If you’ve told us you’ll have a support person for the appointment, but they won’t be with you, we can call them. You’ll need to give us a phone number for us to call them on.

You need to tell a support person the appointment time and how we’ll contact them.

Also let them know they may be asked to identify themselves at the appointment.

If you’ve booked a face to face appointment

We ask you to arrive at the service centre about 10 minutes before your appointment time.

This gives you time to check in. If you’ve booked an appointment, you won’t need to wait in the queue.

You will need to prove who you are. Make sure you bring your ID and any documents you need with you.

You can prove who you are by using photo ID such as a driver licence or an Australian passport. The photo is important for us to compare to your face. We can’t accept a photograph, screenshot or photocopy of your identity document. If you don’t bring in approved photo ID, we’ll need you to correctly answer some questions to prove who you are.

If you’re attending an appointment with a support person, you need to tell them the appointment time and location.

Also let them know they may be asked to identify themselves at the appointment.

## Change an appointment

You can [manage your appointments](/how-to-manage-your-appointments-online?context=64107) online using your Centrelink online account through myGov or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app. Or you can call your [regular payment line](/phone-us?context=64107).

If you’re attending an appointment with a support person, you’ll need to tell them about any changes to the appointment.
