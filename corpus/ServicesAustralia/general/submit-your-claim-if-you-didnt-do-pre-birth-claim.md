# Submit your claim if you didn’t do a pre-birth claim

If you didn’t do a pre-birth claim, you can start a claim after the birth of your baby.

You can claim for the following payments and services:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit), including [Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement)
-   [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can claim and submit your proof of birth online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Make a claim or view claim status**, then **Make a claim**.
3.  Under **Families** select **Get started**.
4.  Select **Apply for Family Assistance (including Paid Parental Leave)** then follow the prompts to complete your claim.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

When we process a claim for your child, we’ll create a Customer Reference Number (CRN) for them. You can find your child’s CRN in your:

-   Centrelink online account by selecting **My Profile** from the homepage, then **My family**
-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app) in the **My family** tab.

## To enrol for Medicare services

When you finalise your pre-birth claim for family assistance payments, we’ll enrol your child for Medicare services. You don’t need to give us the proof of birth again.
