## What to tell us

You need to tell us if there are changes to any of the following:

-   your address, personal and contact details
-   your bank details
-   care arrangements for anyone in your care, including your children
-   your accommodation details, see how you can [do this online](/centrelink-online-account-help-update-address-accommodation-and-contact-details)
-   your employment or work details
-   your study details.

You may be able to [claim](/how-to-claim-essential-medical-equipment-payment?context=21831) another Essential Medical Equipment Payment if you either:

-   change address
-   get an extra piece of medical equipment.

If you use the same medical equipment at your new address, you won’t need to provide medical evidence with your claim.
