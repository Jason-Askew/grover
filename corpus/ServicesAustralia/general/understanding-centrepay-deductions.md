## Mandatory conditions

Setting target amounts and end dates are part of our mandatory conditions.

These can help to avoid an incorrect payment.

If a customer wishes to continue using Centrepay to pay for goods or services, a new deduction will need to be set up with the relevant mandatory condition applied.

### Setting target amounts

Businesses can set a target amount for customers that have a specific amount to pay.

Most [goods and services](/centrepay-goods-and-services?context=22366) have a mandatory target amount. A deduction stops when it reaches the target amount.

You can add target amounts to a new deduction or to an existing deduction.

A deduction stops when it reaches the target amount.

### Setting an end date

Any business can set an end date for a deduction that needs a set time limit.

Most [goods and services](/centrepay-goods-and-services?context=22366) have a mandatory end date. Deductions will stop on the end date.

You can add an end date to a new deduction or to an existing deduction.

An end date cannot be more than 12 months from the date the deduction is started.

More information about incorrect payments can be found in the [Centrepay Terms of Use and Policy for Businesses](/centrepay-policy-terms-and-guides?context=23256).

### Minimum amount

There is a $10 minimum amount for each Centrepay deduction.

## Suspending deductions

You can suspend a deduction for up to 13 weeks if a customer doesn’t need a deduction for a short period. This may help to avoid an incorrect payment.

Call our [Centrepay for businesses team](/business-and-employer-contact-information#centrepaybusinesses) to set this up.

The deduction will restart again at the end of the suspension period.

## Adjusting deductions

Deductions for service reasons being removed from 1 November 2026 can’t be increased after 3 November 2025.

The following applies to service reasons remaining on Centrepay after 1 November 2026.

To avoid an incorrect payment or catch-up missed payments you can make either:

-   temporary increases, with customer consent
-   decreases to deductions for up to 13 weeks. Deductions will go back to the original amount on the end date.

You can also increase or decrease deductions permanently.
