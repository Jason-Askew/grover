# Supporting your employees who get a payment from us

Your employee may get a payment from us. What they get may mean different things for you as an employer.

Your employee may get a payment that means different things to you. This can include Paid Parental Leave scheme or income support payments.

## Supporting working parents

The Paid Parental Leave scheme provides financial support for eligible parents. This scheme helps parents take time off work to care for a newborn or recently adopted child.

There are 2 payments available to families under the scheme. As an employer you can read about [supporting your staff when they get Paid Parental Leave](/paid-parental-leave-scheme-for-employers).

Read more about [supporting working parents toolkit](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sex-discrimination/supporting-working-parents-toolkit-employers) on the Human Rights Commission website.

## Supporting your employees in redundancy or retrenchment

If your employee is facing redundancy or retrenchment, we can help.

Read about how we can support you and your staff, as well as your [redundancy requirements as an employer](/redundancy-information-for-employers).

## Giving us information about an employee

You may need to give us information about an employee who stops working for you.

The easiest way to provide information to us is online using our [business online services](/business-online-services?context=60075). Read more about how you can provide information online for:

-   [Employment status verification](/employment-status-verification)
-   [Garnishee notice to employers for deductions from salaries or wages](/garnishee-notice-to-employers-for-deductions-from-salaries-or-wages)
-   [Employment Separation Certificates](/employment-separation-certificates-for-employers).

### If you’re reporting via Single Touch Payroll (STP)

If you report via STP, we get certain cessation information automatically. This has reduced the number of Employment Separation Certificate requests for employers.

But, if your former employee asks for one, you must provide one.

## Accessing other government resources

Use the [working parents guide](https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/sex-discrimination/working-parents-quick-guide-your-rights) on the Human Rights Commission website to read about your legal obligations for supporting employees who are:

-   pregnant
-   on parental leave
-   returning to work.

Read more on the Workforce Australia website about:

-   how to get help for employing a mature age worker for 12 months or more through the Workforce Australia Services Wage Subsidy on the [Workforce Australia](https://workforceaustralia.gov.au/) website.
