# How to contact a social worker

You can speak to a social worker over the phone.

You can contact a social worker by calling us on the same number you use to call [Centrelink](/phone-us#ces) and asking to speak with one.

If you don’t usually call us, you can call the [Employment Services line](/phone-us#jobseekers) and ask to speak with a social worker.

If you need an interpreter, let us know and we’ll arrange one for you. You can also call our [Multilingual Phone Service](/phone-us#languages).

Our interpreters follow a code of ethics. This means they won’t tell anyone else what you’ve talked about.

## Trained and qualified

All our social workers have a social work degree and provide their service at no cost to you.

We consult with the Australian Association of Social Workers to maintain the highest professional standards.
