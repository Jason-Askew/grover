The number of days your family can get depends on your child’s date of birth or adoption. You can get Parental Leave Pay before, during or after any paid or unpaid employer funded leave. This includes all of the following:

-   maternity or parental leave
-   annual leave
-   long service leave.

If you have a multiple birth, for example twins or triplets, you can only get Parental Leave Pay for one child. Read more about having [multiple children](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement-amount-for-multiple-children).

When your payment starts depends on when you claim. You’ll need to [choose how to take your payment](/choose-how-to-take-your-parental-leave-pay?context=64479).

Parental Leave Pay is a taxable payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=64479).

## Rate of payment

The current payment for Parental Leave Pay is $189.62 a day before tax, or $948.10 per 5 day week. This is based on the weekly rate of the national minimum wage.

The rate of Parental Leave Pay usually changes on 1 July each year. The rate of payment you get depends on when in the financial year you take your leave. You’ll get the rate that applies for the financial year of the day or days you are claiming for. This may mean you get different rates. The rate isn’t based on when your child was born or adopted.

## Number of days

Your child’s date of birth or adoption will determine how many days you can get. If you’re partnered, the date will also determine how many days your partner can get.

Child’s date of birth or adoption is from

Your family can get up to

1 July 2023

100 days, or 20 weeks based on a 5 day work week

1 July 2024

110 days, or 22 weeks based on a 5 day work week

1 July 2025

120 days, or 24 weeks based on a 5 day work week

1 July 2026

130 days, or 26 weeks based on a 5 day work week

If you submit a pre-birth claim for a child before 1 July 2026, your Parental Leave Pay day balance will be 120 days. Once we get proof of birth or adoption confirming your child was born or adopted from 1 July 2026, we’ll add an extra 10 days to your balance to bring it to 130 days. You won’t need to make a new claim.

## Days you share

If you’re a single parent, you’ll get all Parental Leave Pay days. However, if you choose, you can give approval to share Parental Leave Pay with another parent.

If you have a partner, some of your Parental Leave Pay will be reserved for them to use. You’ll need to decide together how to use the rest of the days. How many days you have reserved depends on your child’s date of birth or adoption.

There’s a limit to how many Parental Leave Pay days you can take at the same time. If your child’s date of birth or adoption is:

-   before 1 July 2025, take up to 10 days at the same time
-   from 1 July 2025, take up to 20 days at the same time.

There are some [exemptions that apply to this limit](/exemptions-to-limit-for-taking-days-parental-leave-pay-same-time?context=64479).

## Superannuation

If your child is born or adopted from 1 July 2025, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will pay a superannuation contribution on your Parental Leave Pay. This is called the Paid Parental Leave Superannuation Contribution.

This contribution will be calculated and paid automatically into your superannuation fund after the relevant financial year has ended. You don’t need to submit a separate claim.

The contribution amount is based on the superannuation guarantee rate.
