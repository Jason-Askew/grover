## About the service

The Automated Child Support information service is a telephone service that gives you information about your:

-   next child support payment
-   last child support payment.

You can use the service if both of the following apply to you:

-   you receive child support
-   we collect those child support payments for you.

The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can access it from anywhere in Australia for the cost of a local call. Higher rates may apply for calls from mobiles, public phones and from overseas.

## Preparing to call

Before you call you should have with you:

-   your Child Support Reference Number (CSRN), you can find this on letters we have sent you
-   your Child Support Personal Identification Number (PIN), this can’t be a temporary PIN
-   something to write with, such as a pen and paper.

If you’ve forgotten your PIN, you can [reset](#resetting) it.

## Calling the service

When you call the service, you should:

-   be in a quiet place so the service can clearly hear you
-   listen to the welcome message and menu carefully as choices and information may change
-   speak naturally, you don't need to slow down or shout
-   answer the questions the service asks you
-   follow the instructions.

Access the service by calling the [Child Support info service line](#toolbar-phone).

Make sure you:

1.  Say your CSRN.
2.  Enter your PIN into your phone keypad. 

You can also say your PIN but we suggest using your keypad for privacy.

You'll then hear details about your next child support payment. To hear details about your last payment, say **last payment**.

## Resetting your PIN

If you forget your PIN, we can reset it. You can ask us to reset it by either:

-   completing the online [Contact Us](https://processing.csa.gov.au/contact/ContactUs.aspx) form
-   calling us on the [Child Support enquiry line](#toolbar-phone) during business hours, please be ready with your CSRN.

## Changing your PIN

You can change your PIN with the phone menu options:

-   say **change my PIN**
-   Enter your new 4 digit PIN into your phone keypad.

Keep in mind you can say your PIN but we suggest using your keypad for privacy.

## Keeping your account secure

It’s important to keep your account details secure. Don’t share your CRSN or PIN with anyone.

To keep your account secure, change your PIN often.

To confirm your identity when you call, we’ll always ask for your CSRN and PIN.

If your account is accessed using your CSRN and PIN, we’ll assume this is you. If you think someone else has accessed your account, tell us as soon as possible. Call us on the [Child Support enquiry line](#toolbar-phone).
