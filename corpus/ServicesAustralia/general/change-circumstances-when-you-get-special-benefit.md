# Change of circumstances

We need to know about changes that could reduce, increase or stop your Special Benefit payment.

## on this page

-   [How and when to tell us](#a1)
-   [If you don’t tell us](#a2)

You need to tell us if any of these details change for you or your partner:

-   name
-   relationship status
-   address
-   [you sell your principal home](/real-estate-assets?context=22281#ifyousellyourprincipalhome)
-   income
-   account balance and whether this goes above the allowable limit
-   eligibility to lodge a tax return
-   [care arrangements](/changing-your-childs-care-arrangements)
-   you’re sick or injured and unable to do your usual work or study load and can provide a [medical certificate](/getting-medical-certificate-for-special-benefit?context=22281)
-   work or [study load](/study-loads-for-austudy-and-youth-allowance?context=22441)
-   visa subclass.

## How and when to tell us

You need to tell us if your circumstances change within 14 days. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can tell us online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account, you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

It’s never too late to report a change.

### If you change or correct your name

It’s important to [tell us if you change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink).

## If you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about changes in your life, we may pay you too much. If this happens, you’ll have to [pay the money back](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink), plus a fee.

If you deliberately don’t tell us about changes, we could charge you with [fraud](/report-fraud).

Read about [how to avoid fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud).
