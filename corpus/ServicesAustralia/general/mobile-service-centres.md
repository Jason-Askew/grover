# Mobile service centres

Our staff travel in mobile service centres (MSCs) to rural and regional areas to help people with our services and payments.

Our MSCs allow us to take government services to people who wouldn’t usually have access to them. If you live in a part of Australia that’s far away from a traditional service centre, this service means we can provide a face to face service to you.

Our staff can help you and your family with payments and services for Medicare and Centrelink.

During natural disasters and emergencies, our MSCs can provide on-the-ground support for disaster recovery efforts.

For veterans and their families, our staff can help you connect to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) phone line and online services.

Watch our video to find out how MSCs take services into rural and regional Australia.
