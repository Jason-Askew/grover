## Why we collect your information

We need to collect information about you so we can process and manage your claim and payments and provide services to you. If you don’t provide this information, we may not be able to do any of the following:

-   process your claim
-   determine your eligibility for a payment
-   provide other services to you.

We use automated decision-making systems and tools to help us provide the services, and undertake the activities, described in this privacy notice. We may use your personal information with those systems and tools. If we do, we will comply with all applicable laws when using those systems and tools. Our use of these systems and tools does not affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.

## Who we may share your information with

We only share your information with other parties where you’ve agreed, or where the law allows or requires it. If you choose to use your Digital ID, we’ll also collect information from and disclose information about you to your identity provider, such as your state or territory driver licence authority. This allows us to verify your identity electronically.  
  
If you choose not to allow us to collect this information, you may need to provide identification documents in person at one of our service centres. We’ll also use information you’ve previously given Services Australia to assess this claim and to administer this emergency payment.

We may share your information with Australian and state government departments and organisations, including as part of the emergency response and recovery effort for this disaster.
