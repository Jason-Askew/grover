# What to consider

Before applying for the Residential Costs Option, you should compare costs, whether it works out better to apply or not.

## Example

Luke is 18 and approved to live away from home. He's in his first year of university and will live on campus for 36 weeks of the year. He'll live off campus for 16 weeks. His ABSTUDY Living Allowance is $300 per fortnight. Luke can also get Rent Assistance when he's living on campus. His residential costs are $280 per week.

### Choice 1 if Luke applies for the Residential Costs Option

While Luke is living on campus for 36 weeks, his ABSTUDY Living Allowance will reduce to $41.60 per fortnight. For the other 16 weeks, Luke will get his full ABSTUDY Living Allowance rate of $300. But he won't get Rent Assistance.

### Choice 2 if Luke does not apply for the Residential Costs Option

Luke will get ABSTUDY Living Allowance all year and Rent Assistance while he's living on campus for 36 weeks. He'll also get Relocation Scholarship for moving to study.

Payment

Living Allowance

Rent Assistance

Relocation Scholarship

In Luke’s first year of study, his yearly total is higher if he doesn’t choose the Residential Costs Option.

But, in his next years of study the Residential Costs Option may be the best option. This is because his rate of Relocation Scholarship will decrease.
