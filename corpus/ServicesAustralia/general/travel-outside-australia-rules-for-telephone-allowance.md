For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you leave Australia to live in another country, your allowance will stop when you depart.

If your travel is short term, you’ll get Telephone Allowance if all of these apply:

-   you’re getting your main payment
-   your Telephone Allowance payday is within the first 6 weeks of your travel
-   you continue to pay for a phone or internet service.

Check the travel rules for your main [payment while outside Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22226) to find out:

-   if you can get your payment when you depart
-   when and how to tell us about your travel plans.

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.
