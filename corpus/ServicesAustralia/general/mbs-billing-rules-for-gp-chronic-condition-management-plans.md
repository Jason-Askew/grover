# GP chronic condition management plans

Rules about billing Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items for chronic condition management and how to apply them.

## on this page

-   [General practitioner chronic condition management plans (GPCCMP)](#gpmanagement)
-   [Billing chronic condition management (CCM) items](#billing)
-   [Co-claiming restrictions](#coclaiming)
-   [Mental Health Case Conferences](#mentalhealth)

Learn the relevant item descriptions, fact sheets and explanatory notes on the [MBS Online](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/) website.

If your patient has a chronic medical or terminal condition, they may be eligible for services under:

-   General practitioner chronic condition management plans (GPCCMP)
-   Mental health case conferences (MHCC).

The patient’s usual medical practitioner or someone at the same practice should bill GPCCMP items. You’re a patient’s usual medical practitioner if you, or are located at a medical practice that either:

-   has provided the majority of services to the patient in the past 12 months
-   will provide the majority of services in the following 12 months.

Patients registered through MyMedicare must access GPCCMP items through the practice where they are registered.

## General practitioner chronic condition management plans (GPCCMP)

Once your patient agrees with their GPCCMP, offer them a copy and add a copy to their medical record. To prepare a GPCCMP, you can bill item 392 if you’re a prescribed medical practitioner or item 965 if you’re a GP.

A range of MBS-supported multidisciplinary services may be available to patients with a GPCCMP if those services are eligible with their plan.

## Billing chronic condition management (CCM) items

To be eligible for a GPCCMP, your patient must have at least one medical condition that has been, or is likely to be, present for at least 6 months or is terminal.

You can bill these MBS item numbers for CCM.

You can provide these services more frequently in exceptional circumstances. For example, when there is a significant change in a patient’s condition.

Note on the patient’s invoice or receipt, or include service text for electronic claims if there’s either:

-   exceptional circumstances
-   significant change in clinical condition.

This helps us to assess the claim.

We suggest that practices call and encourage patients to attend an appointment to review their care plan.
