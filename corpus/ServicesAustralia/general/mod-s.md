# Separation details form (MOD S)

Use this form to let us know you’ve separated from your partner.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

You may be able to tell us online that you’ve separated instead of filling in this form. Read about [updating relationship changes](/updating-your-relationship-status) and who can do it online.

If you can’t do it online, download and complete the [Separation details form](/sites/default/files/2025-05/mods-2505en-f.pdf "PDF document"). You don’t need your ex-partner to complete their part of the form.

Remember to sign it before you submit it with your supporting documents.
