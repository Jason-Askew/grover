## When to tell us about your travel

You must tell us within 14 days if any of the following apply:

-   either you or the person you care for goes overseas
-   you go overseas together but will spend some time apart
-   you go overseas together for more than 6 weeks
-   either of you are leaving to live in another country.

Going overseas includes going on a cruise into international waters.

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you, or the person you care for, leave. They will also tell us when you, or the person you care for, return.
