Community Partnership Specialist Officers work alongside non-government organisations in local communities around Australia. We support people who have significant barriers accessing government payments and services.

## How we can help

We work in partnership with specific non-government organisations on a full-time basis to help customers access the payments and services they need.

We can help to:

-   support customers access payments and services
-   connect customers with other services they need.

If you need support now, our [social workers](/social-work-services) can help you. They can help with information, support and short term counselling.

## Where to find us

If you’re a non-government organisation and you’re interested in accessing our services and support, we have a range of community engagement specialists. You can contact your local service centre manager who will help direct you to the most appropriate support.
