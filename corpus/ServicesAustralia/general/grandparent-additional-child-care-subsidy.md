# The Grandparent subsidy

You need to meet certain criteria to be eligible for the Additional Child Care Subsidy Grandparent.

To be eligible for the Grandparent subsidy, you or your partner must:

-   be eligible for [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy)
-   get an income support payment
-   be the grandparent of the child
-   have 65% or more care of the child
-   make the day to day decisions about the child’s care, welfare and development.

A grandparent is a child’s biological grandparent or great grandparent. This includes if you’re related to the child through any of the following:

-   adoption
-   step parents, including former step parents
-   artificial conception
-   de facto relationships
-   surrogacy arrangements.

If you have 65% or more care of the child but don’t get an [income support payment](/income-support-payment), you won’t be eligible for this subsidy. However, you may be eligible for [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) and a recognised participation exemption.
