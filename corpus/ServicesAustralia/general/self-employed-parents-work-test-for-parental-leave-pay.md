You may still meet the work test for Parental Leave Pay if you’re self-employed.

You can include your hours of work, if you’re undertaking the work for financial reward or gain. This includes businesses that don’t currently run at a profit.

This includes all of the following:

-   providing goods and services for hire or reward
-   carrying on a business, including as a partnership or enterprise
-   working for a trust operating as a business.

If you get Parental Leave Pay and you’re self-employed [we’ll make the payments](/getting-your-parental-leave-pay?context=64479#when) to you.
