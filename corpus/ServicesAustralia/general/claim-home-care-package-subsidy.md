# Home care claims

Submit a Home Care Package Subsidy claim using the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

On 1 November 2025, the Support at Home program replaced the Home Care Packages program. The final monthly claim for Home Care Packages will be October 2025. Learn more about [Support at Home](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/support-at-home) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

Steps to submit a monthly Home Care Package Subsidy claim using the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

You’ll need an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to [access the ACPP](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)

### Get ready to claim

Work out how much was spent on care services for each person in your care during the claim period. To do this, calculate the cost of delivering the services. Then subtract any basic daily and additional service fees the care recipient pays. We refer to this as the invoice amount.

You don’t need to give us a breakdown of the costs, fees and invoices but you must keep a record for compliance checks.

You can’t adjust invoice amounts after the claim has been finalised for the claim period.

Before you start a home care package claim you may want to read about home care packages, cost of care and estimating fees.

Learn about what to do [before making a home care package claim](/before-making-home-care-package-claim?context=20).

If you need help to submit your claim you can call us on the [aged care providers enquiry line](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#agedcare).

### Make your claim

Log in to the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP). If you have multiple services, go to the **Service ID bar** to make sure you’re in the correct service.

Enter invoice amounts for either:

-   one care recipient at a time by selecting the **Care recipient profile**, then **Invoice amount** from the **Commonwealth amount tab**
-   multiple care recipients on one screen by selecting **Bulk invoice amount** from the quick links menu.

You can also import a CSV file directly to the ACPP. For each care recipient the file must contain the:

-   Service NAPS ID
-   claim period
-   care recipient ID
-   invoice amount.

To use the CSV file import option on the **Bulk invoice amount screen**, select **Import CSV**. Or you can export a CSV file with your care recipients’ details to add the invoice amounts in the relevant column. If any of the data in the file is incorrect, errors will display on screen. All errors must be fixed before submitting your claim.

To avoid errors, make sure:

-   you use your Service NAPS ID, not your organisation’s - you can find this in the Service details bar in the Aged Care Provider Portal.
-   there are no commas in any of the columns
-   EOF appears at the end of the file to tell the system the file is complete
-   there are no quotation marks in any of the fields, including around the EOF
-   there are no commas, negative amounts or non-numerical values, such as $ @ # ! in the amount column
-   you’ve saved the file as a CSV - the system can only read CSV files.

There are changes to claiming as part of the transition to Support at Home. You can learn more about making sure your claim is correct from either:

-   [Home care sample files](/get-sample-files-for-home-care-claims?context=20)
-   [Support at Home invoice sample files](/support-home-invoicing-and-home-care-account-adjustments?context=20).

### Submit your claim

Enter invoice amounts for each care recipient. If a care recipient didn’t get any services during the claim period, you need to enter **0** as their invoice amount. You can’t leave the amount blank. You must enter the invoice amount every month, even when you’re using any unspent amount to cover some or all costs.

Make sure you enter the correct invoice amount because you can’t change it after you submit your claim.

Then select **Submit** to save the invoice amounts.

## Finalise your claim

To finalise a claim make sure you’re working in the correct service using the **Service ID bar**.

Once you’re in the correct service:

1.  Select **Current claim** in the quick links menu (from the service home page).
2.  Once the Current claim screen has loaded, select **Finalise claim**.
3.  A warning message will be displayed to notify you about possible outstanding events that are still being processed. Select **Yes** to continue or **No** to cancel.
4.  We’ll check to make sure the mandatory information has been submitted.
5.  Following the validation of invoice amounts, you’ll see the **Certification by approved provider/authorised agent** screen. This screen will ask you confirm you have read and understood and accept the terms and conditions of submitting the claim. Check the box to proceed, then select **Submit**.
6.  If you’ve successfully submitted the claim, you’ll see a successful receipt screen. If you return to the **All service claims** screen, you’ll see a status of **Processing** next to the claim you’ve just finalised.
