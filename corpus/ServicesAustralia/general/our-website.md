## Our website

Many Australians trust servicesaustralia.gov.au for up-to-date information about government payments and services. 

Our website is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

With an average of 280,000 sessions per day, it’s one of our most prominent communication channels. It’s a reliable resource for customers, staff and third parties.  

## How our website works

We structure the information on our website around key life events our customers experience. This includes things such as raising kids, living arrangements, and health and disability. This makes it easier to find information that’s relevant to people’s different circumstances.

We also use plain English when we can.

We test our website with a people from different backgrounds and demographics. This includes people with disabilities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people who don’t speak English as their first language.

We also reworked our [health professionals](/health-professionals) content to become more relevant and task focussed.
