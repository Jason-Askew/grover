# How to manage my current payment or card

There are things you need to do to keep getting your payment or replace a card if you’ve been affected by a disaster.

## Update your details with us

If your details or circumstances change, tell us as soon as you can. This can include things like a temporary change of address.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now and select **My details** to tell us about your changes.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you can’t tell us online, you can:

-   [call us](/phone-us) on your regular payment line
-   visit a [service centre, Agent or Access Point](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

## Child Support

If you have a child support assessment and your situation has changed, you need to update your details. This includes if your income or care of your children has changed. This is important so we can make sure your assessment is correct.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov you can update your details online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.csaonline.gov.au/csos_site/csos-base/basePage.jsf?wec-appid=cssr_app&wec-locale=en_US)

You can also use the [Express Plus Child Support mobile app](/express-plus-child-support-mobile-app) or call the [Child Support enquiry line](/phone-us#csgeneralenquiries).

## Job seekers

Your mutual obligation or participation requirements may be paused because of a natural disaster. During this period, no payment suspensions or financial penalties will apply if you don’t meet your mutual obligation or participation requirements. Check which areas have a [pause of requirements](/pause-requirements?context=51411).

You must still report any income you and your partner get every 2 weeks, even if it’s $0. This is so we can pay you the right amount. Read about [employment income reporting](/employment-income-reporting).

## Replace a lost card

You can ask for a replacement concession or health care card.

You can use the self service facilities to order a replacement card at any of these:

-   a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   a [Mobile Service Centre](/mobile-service-centres)
-   an [Agent or Access Point](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

You can also [replace your Medicare card or get an extra card](/get-new-medicare-card-if-it-expires-or-lost-stolen-or-damaged).

You can also get a digital copy of your card through the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app) or [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

There may be some places that won’t accept a digital copy of your card. We’ll send your replacement card to the address you have registered with us. Don’t forget to update your address if it’s changed.
