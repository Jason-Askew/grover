# Review an EDP

After a health professional has provided an Eating Disorder Treatment and Management Plan (EDP), you must continue to manage and review over the next 12 months.

You must review treatment and management plans after every 10 psychological treatment services, or sooner if needed.

You’ll need to do 3 reviews if your patient needs all 40 psychological treatment services under their plan.

Eating disorder plans expire after 12 months. You must renew a plan before your patient can access further psychological or dietetic treatment services.

You can read more information and view infographic resources about [eating disorders treatment and management plans](https://hpe.servicesaustralia.gov.au/MBS_MH.html) on the Health Professional Education Resources (HPE) website.
