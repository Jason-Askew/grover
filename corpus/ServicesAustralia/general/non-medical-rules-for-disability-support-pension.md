# Non-medical rules

You need to meet all the non-medical rules to get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

The non-medical rules you need to meet are:

-   you must be at least 15 years and 9 months and under [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension) when you claim
-   you meet the [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   you meet the [income and assets tests](/income-and-assets-tests-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

You can start your claim early, from 13 weeks before you turn 16. If you’re under 16 when claiming, you can only be paid from when you turn 16.

If you don’t meet all the non-medical rules, you can’t get DSP.

Keep in mind, you’ll also need to meet [medical rules](/medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) to get DSP.

You may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276), if you can’t get DSP.
