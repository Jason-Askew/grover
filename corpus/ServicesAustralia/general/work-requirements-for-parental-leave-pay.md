# Work requirements

To get Parental Leave Pay, you need to meet a work test.

## How to meet the work test

To meet the work test you need to have worked for both:

-   10 of the 13 months before the birth or adoption of your child
-   a minimum of 330 hours, around one day a week, in that 10 month period.

Keep in mind, we count 10 months as 295 days and 13 months as 392 days.

There are many [activities that count as work](/activities-count-work-for-parental-leave-pay?context=64479), including paid leave.

You can include any periods of time that you worked, or did an approved activity, in the 10 month period. You can include work for multiple employers, and combine approved activities to meet the work test. You can’t have more than a 12 week gap between each workday in that 10 month period.

We've got [examples to help you apply the work test](/work-test-examples-for-parental-leave-pay?context=64479).

Read an example of meeting the work test [when you have a gap between work days](/work-test-examples-for-parental-leave-pay?context=64479#gap).

## Who needs to meet the work test

If you’re the birth mother or adoptive parent to first claim Parental Leave Pay, you must meet the work test.

If you’re another parent, you and the birth mother must both meet the work test. For Parental Leave Pay, another parent can be one of the following:

-   the birth mother’s partner
-   the biological father
-   the biological father’s partner.

If your partner adopted the child and you’re not included on the adoption documents, both you and your partner must meet the work test.

## What exceptions there are

There are some exceptions to the work test, such as for pregnancy related illness, complications and premature birth. A Dangerous Jobs provision may also apply.
