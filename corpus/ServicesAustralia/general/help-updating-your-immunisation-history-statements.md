# Updating your immunisation history statements

Find out how we can help you update your immunisation history statements so that it shows your COVID-19 vaccinations.

## on this page

-   [If your vaccinations aren’t showing](#a1)
-   [If your details are wrong](#a2)
-   [If your details aren’t showing](#a3)

When you get a vaccination, your vaccination provider records it on the [Australian Immunisation Register](/australian-immunisation-register?context=60091) (AIR). This can take up to 10 days, or longer in some situations.

Your vaccination provider could be any of the following:

-   your local GP
-   your community pharmacist
-   a Commonwealth vaccination clinic where you were vaccinated
-   a state or territory vaccination hub where you were vaccinated.

If you need hard copy proof and you were vaccinated at a clinic or hub, ask your GP to print your statement. You can also call the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone) and ask us to send you a copy. Vaccination hubs and clinics can’t print your statement.

## If your vaccinations aren’t showing

If your vaccinations aren’t showing after 10 days, check with your provider to confirm they’ve updated your record.

## If your details are wrong

If you need to update your details on your vaccination record, contact the provider that vaccinated you. Vaccination clinics and hubs can’t update your details unless you were vaccinated there.

If your vaccination record has errors, you need to ask your provider to update it. They can correct any of these:

-   number of doses
-   dates of vaccination
-   vaccine brand.

If your provider can’t update your record, call the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone).

## If your details aren’t showing

If you’ve checked with your provider but your details still aren’t showing, it may be because the details recorded don’t match your AIR record. You may need to check your name and address.

To do this, [update your address and contact details](/medicare-online-account-help-update-your-personal-details?context=60091) using your Medicare online account. If you can’t update your details online or they’re correct and you still can’t see your vaccinations, call the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone).
