# When to complete a certificate

We may ask you to complete an ESC under certain circumstances.

When any of the following applies:

-   someone stops working for you
-   your employee decreases their working hours or changes from full time to casual work.

You must provide an ESC if we or an employee or former employee request one. The _Social Security (Administration) Act 1999_ allows a former employee or us to obtain this information under:

-   section 196 if we request it
-   section 199 if a former employee requests it.

Please consider giving a printed copy of the information to the employee, for their own records.

To submit an ESC, register your business in [Business Hub](/business-hub). You don’t have to register again if you already registered for the Paid Parental Leave scheme.

## Circumstances other than termination of employment

You may need to complete a certificate in circumstances other than termination of employment. Use the **Reason for separation** section to provide more information.

For example, you can provide more detail about a decrease in working hours or a change from full time to casual work.
