## Things to think about

There are things you need to think about when taking out a loan or using credit, this includes:

-   if this is something you need now
-   if you can save up for it and pay in full later
-   if making repayments will make your budgeting tight
-   if repayments will make it hard to pay for bills, rent or food
-   if repayments will stop you from saving or having money for emergencies
-   if there are other ways to get or pay for what you want.

Before applying for a loan or credit, review or make your budget. That way you’ll know if you can afford the repayments. You can use our tools for managing your money. The simple money manager tool can [help you to budget](/how-to-budget?context=60271). The rent versus buy calculator can help you work out the costs of [renting versus buying household items](/choosing-to-rent-or-buy-goods?context=60271).

If you apply for a loan or credit, always check the terms and conditions. There’ll be things lenders won’t tell you up front. Don’t sign a contract if you still have questions.

There’s finance that’s safe and affordable like a no interest loan from Good Shepherd.

Think about talking to a professional, like a financial counsellor, before you take out a loan or credit. Find out about [free financial help and information](/getting-financial-help-and-information?context=60271).

-   household items like appliances, white goods and furniture
-   car repairs and registration
-   medical, dental, well-being and life event expenses

### Licensed lenders

If you get a loan or credit, it’s a good idea to protect yourself. This may mean taking the time to choose the right loan or lender.

There are laws that licensed lenders must follow when lending money to you.

-   [check for a licensed credit provider](https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/ProfessionalRegisters.jspx)
-   find out more about [loans and credit card rules](https://asic.gov.au/for-consumers/loans-and-credit-cards/).

### Loan scams

Be cautious if you get a phone call or an email from a salesperson offering you a loan or credit. It could be a loan scam. Don’t give them any personal information over the phone or click any links in emails or text messages you think are suspicious.

Protect yourself by doing some research before you agree to anything. A scam can appear as a great deal but will cost you a lot of money if you’re not careful.
