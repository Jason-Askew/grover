You can **Remove** a service provider or see if you can delegate [attributes](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda?context=33786) or [nominees](/managing-nominee-delegations-proda?context=33786) in Service provider details.

You now need to link to the service. Some services will automatically link and other services will need to be authorised by the service provider.

Some health service providers need to you link to them. Find out more about [adding and linking to health service providers](/adding-and-linking-to-health-service-providers?context=33786).
