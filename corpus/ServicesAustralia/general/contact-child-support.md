If you have a general question that you can’t find the answer to, and it’s not urgent, you can make a [general child support enquiry online](https://processing.csa.gov.au/contact/form.aspx). Don’t include sensitive information. We can’t guarantee the security of information sent by this option.

We’ll aim to respond to your enquiry within 28 days via telephone or by mail. If we try to call you in response to your message, it’ll be from a private number.

We won’t leave a voicemail unless you’ve clearly identified yourself in your voicemail service. This is to protect your privacy.

If you require immediate assistance or you’re facing crisis or hardship, [call us](#toolbar-phone).

## If we need to contact you

Once you have an assessment, we may need to contact you from time to time about your child support.

You can request how and when we contact you. To update your preferences, call us on the [Child Support Enquiry Line](#toolbar-phone).

Sometimes we may need to contact you using a different method or outside your preferred contact times. This may happen if:

-   we haven’t been able to reach you through your preferred method
-   you don’t make payments on time
-   we need to resolve a specific matter.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov you can update your contact details online. This includes your phone number and address.
