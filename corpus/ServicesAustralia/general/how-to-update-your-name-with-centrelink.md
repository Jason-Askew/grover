# How to update your name with Centrelink

You can ask us to update your legal name, preferred name or title at any time.

-   [Telling us your preferred name](#preferredname)
-   [Updating your title with us](#a3)

## Changing your legal name with us

To update your legal name you’ll need to bring your supporting documents to a service centre.

You can use any of the following documents issued by Births, Deaths and Marriages:

-   an Australian marriage certificate
-   a Certificate of name change
-   a Birth certificate with your child’s legal name, if you’re changing their name
-   a reissued birth certificate in your new name.

We don’t accept ceremonial marriage certificates as a supporting document for a legal name change.

If you changed your name overseas, you’ll need to provide us with original evidence from the [Department of Home Affairs](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/change-in-situation/contact-details).

In some circumstances, you can [call us on your regular payment line](/phone-us?context=64107) to update your legal name. This includes when you’re either:

-   changing your legal married name back to your former birth or maiden name that you’ve provided to us before
-   requesting simple corrections, such as a spelling error or your name has been recorded in an incorrect order.

## Telling us your preferred name

We’ll use your preferred name when we talk to you. We may need to use your legal name when we write to you.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
