# Income and assets tests

We use income and assets tests to check if you can get Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices and how much you might get.

## on this page

-   [When you’re dependent](#a1)
-   [When you’re independent](#a2)

We base your rate of payment on the test that results in the lowest payment rate. Changes to your income or assets, like changes to your employment income, may change your rate.

## When you’re dependent

If you’re dependent, we’ll work out how much Youth Allowance you can get using either the:

-   [personal income test](/what-personal-income-test-for-youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916)
-   [parental means test](/what-parental-means-test-for-youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916).

## When you’re independent

If you’re independent, we’ll use 2 tests to work out how much Youth Allowance you can get. These are the:

-   [personal income test](/what-personal-income-test-for-youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916)
-   [personal assets test](/what-personal-assets-test-for-youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916).

If you have a partner, we’ll also use the [partner income test](/partner-income-test-for-youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916).

We assess your parents’ or guardians’ income when you claim Youth Allowance as a dependent student or Australian Apprentice.

What the partner income test is

If you’re independent and you have a partner, we assess their gross income too. This is the income they get before any deductions, like tax.
