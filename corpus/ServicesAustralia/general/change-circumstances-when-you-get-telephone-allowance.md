# Change of circumstances

We need to know about changes that could reduce or stop your Telephone Allowance payment.

## on this page

-   [How and when to tell us](#a1)
-   [If you don’t tell us](#a2)

If you don’t tell us when changes happen, you may be doing the wrong thing.

For example, you need to tell us if you’re no longer paying for a phone or internet service.

## How and when to tell us

You need to tell us if your circumstances change within 14 days. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

You can use a self service terminal at a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) to tell us about your changes.

It’s never too late to report a change.

## If you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about changes in your life, we may pay you too much. If this happens you’ll have to pay the money back. Read more about [Centrelink debts and overpayments](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments).

If you deliberately don’t tell us about changes, we could charge you with fraud.

Read [how to avoid fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud?context=22226).
