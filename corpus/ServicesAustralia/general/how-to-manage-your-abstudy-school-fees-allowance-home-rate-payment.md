# How to manage your payment

Your options and obligations when getting ABSTUDY School Fees Allowance at home rate.

There are things you need to do when getting School Fees Allowance at home rate for you or your child. This includes telling us about any:

-   changes to study
-   changes to circumstances.

You can also choose someone to deal with us on your behalf. This includes giving the student’s school [permission to enquire](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=38071#personpermittedtoenquire) if you’ve asked us to pay the allowance directly to them.

[
