## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with biological medicines under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 for patients with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.

Where the term biological medicine appears, it refers to:

-   adalimumab
-   bimekizumab
-   secukinumab

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing biological medicines.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with biological medicines, patients must be treated by a dermatologist.
