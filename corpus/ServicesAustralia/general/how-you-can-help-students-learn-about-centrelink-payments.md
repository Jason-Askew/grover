## Getting students ready to claim

Let students and apprentices know they can apply for some student payments up to 13 weeks before their course starts. Having their supporting documents ready will help them finish their claim. That way, they’re more likely to have their payment when they need it.

If they’re 24 or younger, they can follow these [steps to claim Youth Allowance](/how-to-claim-youth-allowance-for-students-and-apprentices?context=43916).

If they’re 25 or older, they can follow these [steps to claim Austudy](/how-to-claim-austudy#stepsclaim).

To claim ABSTUDY, they’ll need to follow different steps depending on which payment they’re claiming. You may also be able to claim some payments on their behalf. Read more about how you can [support ABSTUDY students](/how-you-can-support-abstudy-students?context=60075).
