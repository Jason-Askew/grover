## The process when you’ve been overpaid

### 1\. We identify an overpayment and check if you owe us money

We may notice you’ve been overpaid after you tell us of a change or complete a review.

Once we know you’ve been overpaid, we check if you have a debt that you need to repay.

If you don’t need to repay money, this is where the process ends.

### 2\. We contact you to explain why you owe money and what you need to do

If you need to repay money, we’ll always send you a letter. The letter will show how much you were overpaid and explain why you owe money. The letter will also include a due date when you need to start repaying the money. We send this in the post or online to your [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online).

Sometimes we’ll call you or send you a text message. Make sure you [check it’s us](/how-to-protect-against-scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271) and not a scammer. If you’re not sure if a call is from us, hang up and call back our [debt recovery line](#toolbar-phone).

If you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian, you can call the [Centrelink Indigenous debt recovery line](/phone-us#indigenousdebt).

For help in your language, you can call the [Centrelink multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can see if you need to repay us money online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **Money you owe**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

There are steps you can take if you:

-   [want us to explain why you were overpaid](/if-you-disagree-or-cant-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271)
-   [disagree with the debt](/if-you-disagree-or-cant-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271)
-   [can’t start repaying the money by your due date](/if-you-disagree-or-cant-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#cantrepay)
-   [are considering a debt agreement or bankruptcy](/if-you-disagree-or-cant-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#debtagreement).

Otherwise, you’ll need to [start repaying the money](/if-youre-ready-to-start-repaying-money-you-owe?context=60271).

### **3\. Talk to us about repayment options**

If you get a Centrelink payment, we’ll deduct money from your payment. You don’t need to do anything, but you can [change how much we deduct](/repaying-money-you-owe-if-you-get-payment-from-us?context=60271#deductingfrompayment).

If you [no longer get a Centrelink payment](/repaying-money-you-owe-if-you-no-longer-get-payment-from-us?context=60271), you should either:

-   repay the money in full
-   set up a payment arrangement.

The due date is usually 28 days after we send you the letter.

By the due date, you need to have done one of the following:

-   repaid the money in full
-   set up a payment arrangement with us
-   got an [extension to your due date](/if-you-disagree-or-cant-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#cantrepay).

If you haven’t done one of these things, and you’re not getting a Centrelink payment, we may:

-   [charge you interest](/if-you-dont-take-action-to-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#interestcharges)
-   ask the ATO to withhold or garnishee some or all of your tax refund
-   ask your employer, bank or other organisation to [help us recover the money](/if-you-dont-take-action-to-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#organisations)
-   [issue a Departure Prohibition Order](/if-you-dont-take-action-to-repay-centrelink-debt?context=60271#departureprohibitionorders).

In rare situations, we may take legal action.

We only take these actions as a last resort if we haven’t heard from you. So please contact us before the due date if you can’t repay the money.

## Help when you’ve been overpaid

## Special circumstances debt waivers

In some situations, we may be able to waive your debt if there are special circumstances. When we waive your debt, it means you don’t need to repay it.

Special circumstances can include if you’re affected by:

-   Family and domestic violence
-   Natural disasters
-   Homelessness.

To apply for a special circumstances debt waiver review, call us on the [Centrelink debt recovery line](#toolbar-phone).
