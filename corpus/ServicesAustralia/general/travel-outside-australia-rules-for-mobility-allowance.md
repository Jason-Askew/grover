For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you leave Australia to live in another country, your allowance will stop when you depart.

If your travel is short term, you can get payment for up to 6 weeks but you must continue to meet your activity test requirements for your main payment.
