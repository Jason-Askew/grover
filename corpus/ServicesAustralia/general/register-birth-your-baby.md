# Register the birth of your baby

You must register the birth of your baby. This is a requirement by the births, deaths and marriages registry in your state or territory.

The hospital will give you a birth registration form. There’s no cost for registering the birth of your newborn. When you do this, you may want to purchase a birth certificate for your baby.

You must register the birth of your newborn child to get either:

-   Parental Leave Pay
-   the Newborn Supplement component of Family Tax Benefit Part A.

If your baby was stillborn, we don’t need you to register their birth to claim a payment. However, the births deaths and marriages registry in your state or territory will need you to register their birth. The hospital won’t do this for you.
