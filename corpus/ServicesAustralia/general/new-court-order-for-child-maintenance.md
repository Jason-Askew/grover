# New court order

Notify us within 14 days of a court order being made about child maintenance. This includes orders made by consent, and any amendments to earlier orders.

You can apply to a court for a child maintenance order if you're:

-   the parent of the child, including an adoptive parent
-   the child in your own right and do not have a registered child support case with us
-   the grandparent of the child
-   any other person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child.

You can apply to a court for a child maintenance order for a child who is being cared for under child welfare law in certain states and territories in Australia if you're:

-   a parent who has daily care of the child, including an adoptive parent
-   the child in your own right and do not have a registered child support case with us
-   a relative who has daily care of the child
-   a child welfare officer of a state or territory.

To apply for a child maintenance order, contact the [Federal Circuit Court of Australia](http://www.federalcircuitcourt.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/fccweb/home/) or visit the [Family Court of Australia](http://www.familycourt.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/fcoaweb/home/).
