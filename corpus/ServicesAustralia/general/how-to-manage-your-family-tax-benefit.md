# How to manage your payment

Your options and obligations for Family Tax Benefit.

There are things you need to do to manage your Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Payment.

You must tell us if [your circumstances change](/change-circumstances-while-getting-family-tax-benefit?context=22151).

You can [choose how you get Family Tax Benefit (FTB)](/payment-choices-for-ftb?context=22151) if you claim it fortnightly.

Keep in mind that after the end of the financial year, we [balance your payments](/how-to-balance-your-payment-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151) to make sure we pay you the right amount.

You have one year from the end of the financial year to confirm your income for FTB or claim FTB as a lump sum. Read more about [time limits and confirming your income](/time-limits-for-submitting-lump-sum-claims-and-confirming-income-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151).

You can also ask for your Family Tax Benefit payment to be offset. This means your Family Tax Benefit payment can be paid on a different week to your income support payment. [Call us](/contact-us) to find out if you’re eligible.

We have a range of other services, tools and information to help you manage your payment or get extra support.

This includes:

-   tips about [how to manage your money](/manage-your-money).

You can arrange regular deductions from your Centrelink payments to pay bills. Read more about [Centrepay](/centrepay).
