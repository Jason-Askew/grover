[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline%2F%23%2Fair%2Fimmunisationhistory)

You can also use the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Medicare online account, you’ll need to [set them up](/how-to-set-up-your-medicare-online-account). You’ll need these to use the app.

## Help linking Medicare to myGov

Information about why you may not be able to link Medicare to your myGov account and how to correct the error to get proof of your vaccinations.

The reasons why you can’t link your Medicare to your myGov account include the following:

-   we can’t identify you and your Medicare record
-   your details recorded with myGov don’t match your Medicare details
-   you forgot your myGov username or password.

When you can’t link you’ll get an error message. Find out [what to do if you get an error message when linking Medicare to myGov](/common-error-messages-when-linking-medicare-to-mygov).

If you’re asked for your agency reference number when linking, this is your Medicare card number. You must also include your Individual Reference Number. This is the number that appears next to your name on your card. Enter all 11 digits without spaces.

If you can’t use Medicare online, your vaccination provider can print your immunisation history statements for you.

You can also get your statements using your My Health Record. If you haven’t used it before, you need to [link My Health Record to myGov](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/link-my-health-record). Find out more about [getting proof of your vaccinations from My Health Record](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/my-health-record/whats-inside/getting-proof-of-your-vaccinations-from-my-health-record) on the Australian Digital Health Agency website.

You can also call the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone) and ask us to send your immunisation history statements to you. It can take up to 14 days to arrive in the post.

If you’re getting immunisation history statements for your child, they must be under 14.

If you’ve had a vaccination, this is recorded on your immunisation history statements. You can use your immunisation history statement to get proof of your vaccinations.

## Children who are 14 or older

For privacy reasons, anyone aged 14 or older can get their own immunisation history statements.

If their Medicare online account is linked to myGov, they can sign in now to get their statements online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline%2F%23%2Fair%2Fimmunisationhistory)

They can also do this by:

-   using the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   asking their vaccination provider to print it
-   calling the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone).

If your child is older than 14, you can get their immunisation history statements if you have their consent. You can call the [Australian Immunisation Register](/phone-us#acir) and ask us for a copy. Your child will need to speak to the service officer to verify their identity before we can do this. They’ll need to give their consent each time you ask for a copy of the statement.

## If you aren’t eligible for Medicare

If you’re not eligible for Medicare, you can get your immunisation history statements online through myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account, you can go to the myGov website to [create one](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account).

To get your immunisation history statements, link the Individual Healthcare Identifiers service (IHI service) to your myGov account.

You’ll need an [Individual Healthcare Identifier](/how-to-get-individual-healthcare-identifier) (IHI). If you don’t have one, find out [how to get an IHI](/how-to-get-individual-healthcare-identifier).

Once you’ve linked the IHI service:

1.  Sign in to your myGov account.
2.  Select the **Proof of vaccinations** quick link, then **View proof**.
3.  Select your **name** and then **View history**.
4.  Select either **View Complete immunisation history statement (PDF)** or **View COVID-19 and influenza (flu) statement (PDF)**, or **Add to Apple/Google Wallet**, if using a mobile phone or tablet.

[Sign in to myGov](https://my.gov.au/)

## If you can’t have a vaccination for medical reasons

If you can’t get a vaccine for medical reasons, but need to provide proof of vaccination, this can be recorded on your immunisation history statement.

We call this a medical contraindication. Your doctor will need to update your record on the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) to say you have a medical contraindication.

You can then use your immunisation history statement as proof of your vaccination status, if it’s needed.

If you’re recovering from a severe illness, your medical contraindication may only be valid for a few months. After this time, you’ll need to ask your doctor to update your status on the AIR if your medical contraindication is still valid.

Check what some of the medical reasons are for getting an [exemption from having a vaccine](/immunisation-medical-exemptions?context=22436) and who can provide this exemption.

## If you’re a veteran

If you’re a DVA gold card holder and you have a Medicare number, you can access your immunisation history statement online.

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to access your immunisation history statement.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also use the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

If you’re a DVA gold card holder and don’t have a Medicare number, you’ll need to access your My Health Record and link it to your myGov account to get your immunisation history statement.

To do this, you’ll need to call the [My Health Record enquiries line](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/contact-us#accordion-2). They’ll verify your identity and give you an access code, also called an Identity Verification Code, to link your accounts.

Find out how to [get vaccination proof through My Health Record](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/mhr-proof-of-vaccinations) from the Australian Digital Health Agency website.

If you can’t get proof online, you can also call the [Australian Immunisation Register](#toolbar-phone). Select option 4 for the AIR veteran and defence support line. Then ask us to send your proof to you. It can take up to 14 days for your statement to arrive in the post.
