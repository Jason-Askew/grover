# Medical rules

If you don’t meet the manifest medical rules, you need to meet the general medical rules to get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

To get DSP, you need to meet either:

-   manifest medical rules
-   general medical rules.

First, check if you meet any of the [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276). If you do, and you also meet the [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276), you may be able to get DSP.

If you don’t meet the manifest medical rules, you may meet the [general medical rules](/general-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

Not everyone with disability or a medical condition can get DSP.

If you don’t meet either the manifest or general medical rules, you’re not medically eligible. This means you can’t get DSP.

You may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276), if you can’t get DSP.
