For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

The financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June. We balance CCS payments from mid-August. You need to confirm your family income for the financial year before we can balance your payments. If you have a partner, they’ll need to do this too.

If you’re unsure what you need to do to balance your payments, use our [What families need to do at tax time](/what-families-need-to-do-tax-time) tool.

## If you lodge a tax return

Once you or your partner, if you have one, lodge tax returns, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will tell us your incomes. We’ll use this information to balance your CCS.

Some Centrelink payments won’t prefill in your tax return or show on your Centrelink payment summary. Find out more about [what payments don’t show on it](/payments-dont-show-your-payment-summary).

## If you don’t need to lodge a tax return

You must tell us if you or your partner, if you have one, [don’t need to lodge](/advising-non-lodgement-tax-return?context=22151) a tax return. You must do this even if you had no income or you’ve already told the ATO you don’t need to lodge.

We can’t balance your CCS until you tell us how much income you or your partner got.

If you have a Centrelink online account linked to myGov, you can sign in and tell us if you and your partner don’t need to lodge a tax return and confirm your income for the financial year.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/non-lodgement-tax-return/financial-year)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account, you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

You can also tell us using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

Some payments won’t prefill when telling us you don’t need to lodge a tax return online. They also won’t appear on your Centrelink payment summary. You must include all [adjusted taxable income](/what-adjusted-taxable-income?context=41186) you got from Centrelink and any other income you had. This is so we can balance your payments correctly.

If you were affected by a [declared natural disaster](/natural-disaster-support) and got a government payment, you may need to include this as income. You must also include all taxable payments you got from other government departments, including some payments from Veterans’ Affairs.

Find out more about [payments that don’t show](/payments-dont-show-your-payment-summary) on your Centrelink payment summary.

## If you separated from a partner during the financial year

Call the [Centrelink families line](#toolbar-phone) if you separated from your partner and you don’t know if they’re going to lodge a tax return, or if they don’t need to lodge. You don’t need to contact your ex-partner for this information.

### How long you have to confirm your income

There are time limits for how long you have to confirm your income. Find out about the [time limits for CCS](/time-limits-for-confirming-income-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186).

## If you got Family Tax Benefit (FTB)

It’s important to know we balance FTB and CCS separately. If you got CCS, you’ll need to confirm your income, even if you don’t need to for FTB.

If we’ve balanced your FTB based on your tax return details, we’ll use this information to balance your CCS.

If you’ve told us that you don’t need to lodge a tax return and confirmed your income, we’ll use this information to balance your CCS.

Find out more about [balancing FTB](/balancing-family-tax-benefit).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Centrelink families line

Use this line if you need help with family payments, such as Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Subsidy, Parental Leave Pay, Foster Child Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income. We may have sent your child a letter asking for this in September or October, read how you can [update your income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
