## Participation requirements if you’re under 35

There are [participation requirements if you’re under 35](/meeting-participation-requirements-if-youre-under-35?context=22276) for some people getting Disability Support Pension (DSP). This is to help you find and keep suitable work.

## Change of circumstances

You must tell us if things change as it may affect your DSP payment.

Read about what you need to tell us if you have a [change of circumstances](/change-circumstances-while-receiving-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

## Hours you can work

If you get DSP, you can have paid work up to 29 hours a week. You can do this without losing your DSP payment providing you meet the [income test](/income-and-assets-tests-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

You must tell us if you or your partner have started work within 14 days. You must also tell us the details of that work.

Watch our video about working while getting DSP.

You must report any income you and your partner get. You need to report every 2 weeks, even if it’s $0. This is so we pay you the right amount.

If you’re [permanently blind](/disability-support-pension-dsp-if-youre-permanently-blind?context=22276) and get DSP, you are usually exempt from the income test. This means you don’t have to tell us the hours you work or report your employment income. If your partner is getting an income support payment, they will need to tell us about any income you get so we can pay them the right amount.

However, if you’re permanently blind and get Rent Assistance with your DSP, you need to report your employment income each fortnight.
