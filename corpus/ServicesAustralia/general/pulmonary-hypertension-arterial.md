## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with PAH agents as monotherapy, dual therapy or triple therapy under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 100 for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

When the term ‘PAH agent’ appears it refers to:

-   ambrisentan
-   bosentan monohydrate
-   epoprostenol sodium
-   iloprost trometamol
-   macitentan
-   macitentan 10 mg + tadalafil 40 mg
-   riociguat
-   selexipag
-   sildenafil citrate
-   tadalafil.

For the PBS subsidy:

**Dual Therapy (excluding selexipag)** - refers to treatment with a combination of PAH agents for patients with WHO Functional Class III or IV PAH and consists of either:

-   one endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and one phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE-5i)
-   one ERA and one prostanoid
-   one PDE-5i and one prostanoid.

**Triple Therapy (excluding selexipag)** - refers to treatment with a combination of PAH agents for patients with WHO Functional Class III or IV PAH and consists of:

-   one ERA, one PDE-5i and one prostanoid.

**Triple Therapy (including selexipag)** - refers to treatment with a combination of PAH agents for patients with WHO Functional Class III or IV PAH and consists of:

-   the combined use of selexipag, an ERA and a PDE-5i
-   the combined use of selexipag and **either** an ERA **or** a PDE-5i, in cases where a patient cannot receive all 3 agents for clinical reasons.

Approved ERAs for dual and triple therapies are:

-   ambrisentan
-   bosentan
-   macitentan.

Approved PDE-5i’s for dual and triple therapies are:

-   sildenafil
-   tadalafil.

Approved prostanoids for dual and triple therapies are:

-   epoprostenol
-   iloprost.

### Fixed dose combination of macitentan 10 mg with tadalafil 40 mg

This fixed dose combination is for the continuing treatment of PAH in patients stable on separate doses of macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg (two 20 mg) as dual therapy or part of the triple therapy. This treatment is not PBS-subsidised for the use as initial therapy.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing PAH agents.

## Section 100 arrangements

PAH agents are only PBS-subsidised for non-admitted patients, day admitted patients, or patients on discharge who are attending:

-   an approved private hospital
-   a public hospital.

PAH agents aren’t PBS-subsidised for public hospital in-patients. You must include the hospital name and provider number on the authority application form.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with a PAH agent (or agents), patients must be treated by and the authority application completed by a physician with expertise in the management of PAH.
