# Ways to submit the certificate

The easiest way to complete and submit an Employment Separation Certificate (ESC) is online through Business Hub.

## on this page

-   [Business Hub](#a1)
-   [Paper form](#otherways)

You can also submit an ESC by paper form. But you can’t submit a certificate using Single Touch Payroll (STP). If you report via STP, we get certain cessation information automatically. This has reduced the number of separation certificate requests for employers.

## Business Hub

Follow these steps to access the ESC through Business Hub:

1.  If you haven’t already, [register for Provider Digital Access (PRODA)](/how-to-register-organisation-proda) account and [link it to Business Hub](/how-to-access-business-hub#linkbusinesshub).
2.  [Log in to PRODA](https://proda.humanservices.gov.au/prodalogin/pages/public/login.jsf), then select **Business Hub**.
3.  Select **Employment Separation Certificate** on the Business Hub homepage.
4.  Fill out the information then review the details you entered. You’ll need:
    -   the employee’s full name, date of birth and address
    -   employment separation details including key dates and reason for termination
    -   termination payment and leave details for the employee.
5.  To change details you entered, select **Edit**.
6.  Tick the **I accept this declaration box**, then select **Submit**.
7.  Save the receipt number for future reference on the Confirmation page.

If you need help, select **Ask a question** from the bottom of your Business Hub homepage to ask the virtual assistant a question.

We’ll match the details you give us to our records and update the employee’s record.

You can also provide the information on your business letterhead. You, or a pay officer you have authorised, should sign the certificate and keep a copy for your own records.
