# Seemingly valid Medicare card form (PB136)

Use this form if you are a pharmacist who has previously submitted a PBS or RPBS claim to us which has been rejected based on the patients Medicare card number.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Seemingly valid Medicare card form](/sites/default/files/pb136-2112en-f.pdf "PDF document").

Complete this form for your patient if we found that the Medicare or Repatriation card details were invalid, and they have presented another script and cannot provide an alternative Medicare or Repatriation card details.
