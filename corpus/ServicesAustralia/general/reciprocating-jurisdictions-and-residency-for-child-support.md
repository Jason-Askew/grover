# Reciprocating jurisdictions and residency

We have arrangements for child support with a number of countries. We call these reciprocating jurisdictions.

## on this page

-   [How we can help](#a1)
-   [Countries that are reciprocating jurisdictions](#a2)
-   [Excluded jurisdictions](#a3)
-   [Non-reciprocating jurisdictions](#a4)

## How we can help

If you or the other parent live in one of these countries we can help you manage your overseas maintenance.

We will either assist:

-   the parent if we can
-   the authority that manages child support in that country.

Setting up maintenance for you in other countries can be complicated and take a long time. What we can do depends on:

-   our arrangement with the country
-   their laws and processes
