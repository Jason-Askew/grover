# Data matching activities for third party organisation data breaches

Matching data is one of the key controls we use to assist customers in preventing fraud and non-compliance.

## What we’re doing

When we match data, we compare information we get from an outside source with our own.

We’re data matching our Medicare and Centrelink customer records for customers of organisations who’ve recently been affected by a data breach.

We’re doing this to identify any customers at risk of identity compromise and to prevent fraud.

### Protocol

We wrote these protocols with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to meet their [Guidelines on Data Matching in Australian Government Administration](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guidelines-on-data-matching-in-australian-government-administration).
