# Agreements affect your family payments

We’ll make a notional assessment after we accept your agreement. The notional assessment is the child support that would apply if you didn’t have an agreement.

We use it to assess the Family Tax Benefit Part A you get. Read more about [notional assessments](/notional-assessment?context=21921).

Notional assessment

We assess what the child support rate would be if the agreement wasn’t in place. We call this a notional assessment.
