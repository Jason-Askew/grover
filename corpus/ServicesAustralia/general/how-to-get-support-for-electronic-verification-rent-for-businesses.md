# How to get support for your business

There is support for businesses using Electronic Verification of Rent (EVoR).

If you need help using EVoR, contact the [Confirmation Services helpdesk](/business-and-employer-contact-information#confirmation). They’re open 9 am to 5 pm AEST, Monday to Friday, except on national public holidays.

Sometimes problems can happen with online service availability. We’ll try and tell you if it happens and will fix it as soon as we can. We also have planned maintenance periods. You can read more on our [business service changes](/business-service-changes).
