# Residence rules

To be eligible for Assistance for Isolated Children you must meet the residence rules.

On the day you claim, you and the child you’re claiming for must be [living in Australia](/residence-descriptions?context=22121#livinginaustralia) and have one of the following:

-   Australian citizenship
-   a permanent visa
-   a [Special Category visa](/residence-descriptions?context=22121#scv) where a waiting period may apply.

The child does not need to be in Australia at the time of claiming, if they are:

-   enrolled at school in Australia and are on an international student exchange
-   already eligible for Distance Education Allowance and are doing full time distance education while overseas
-   overseas for less than 12 months.

To keep getting your payment, you and the child you’re claiming for must continue to be living in Australia as [Australian residents](/residence-descriptions?context=22276#ausresident).
