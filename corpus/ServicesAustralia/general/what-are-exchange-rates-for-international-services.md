# What are the exchange rates

Your income and assets can change the amount of payment you get from us.

If you have assets in or get income from another country, we work out their value in Australian dollars. To do this we use exchange rates. We use these for our [income test](/income?context=22471) and [assets test](/asset-types?context=22471).

You need to tell us if your income or assets change. You don’t need to do this if they change in value just because of a change in the exchange rate.

Rates we use

We use the buying rate from the Commonwealth Bank as the exchange rate for most currencies. For other currencies we get the rates from other banks.

Income

Most types of income count in your income test. We use this and your assets test to assess if you can get a payment, and to calculate your rate of payment.

Asset types

Assets are property or items you or your partner own in full or part, or have an interest in. They can affect your payment.
