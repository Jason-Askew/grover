# Centrelink impersonation phone call scams

You might get a call claiming to be from Services Australia.

These scam calls tell you to urgently pay a debt. They say that if you don’t pay it straight away, you’ll be arrested.

Often, the callers claim to be from our legal team. They’ll claim:

-   if you don’t pay it straight away, you’ll be arrested
-   you can pay through a bank transfer, gift cards or cryptocurrency.

This call is a scam. There are a few signs to look out for if you get a call like this:

-   we’ll never ask you to transfer money on the phone
-   we won’t make unexpected phone calls threatening to arrest you
-   we also won’t ask you to pay with gift cards or digital currency
-   if you do [owe money](/what-happens-when-youre-overpaid-centrelink?context=60271), we’ll write to you via post or your myGov inbox to let you know.

If you get this call, hang up and remember:

-   don’t return the call
-   don’t transfer money to the caller
-   don’t give the caller your personal details.
