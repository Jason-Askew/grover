# Get help with Centrelink, when you start studying

Published: 27 January 2026

Starting your studies is a big step. If you need help with Centrelink, you can ask someone to act for you while you adjust.

An acting arrangement lets someone you trust help with your Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support. They can ask us questions, make updates, and manage payments for you.

You can cancel the arrangement at any when you feel ready.
