# Meeting obligations

When you get a payment from us, you have obligations. Find out what you need to do to keep getting your payment.

-   [Complete Centrelink updates online](#a4)

We know looking for work can be hard, but we can help with payments and services.

## Payments you can get

You may be eligible for one of our 3 main job seeker payments:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment) is for when you’re looking for work and you’re 22 and over. It’s also for when you’re sick or injured and can’t do your usual work or study for a short time.
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) is if you’re the main carer of a young child or children.
-   [Youth Allowance for job seekers](/youth-allowance-for-job-seekers) is for when you’re looking for work and you’re 16 to 21. It’s also for when you’re completing study or unable to work for a short time.

For more information about the support you can get when you’re unemployed, read about [getting a payment](/getting-payment-when-youre-recently-unemployed).

## Mutual obligation requirements

While you’re looking for work and getting a payment from us, there are tasks and activities you have to do. These are your [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=60070). These requirements will help you find a job.

If you’re referred to Workforce Australia, you may have to meet a monthly points target to meet these requirements.

### If you’re job seeking

You’ll need to meet your requirements to keep getting your payment. Mutual obligation requirements are compulsory and there are penalties if you don’t meet them. Read more about [how to meet your obligations](/what-you-need-to-do-to-meet-mutual-obligations-requirements?context=60070).

If you’re a [principal carer](/mutual-obligation-requirements-for-principal-carers?context=60070) or [aged 55 or over](/mutual-obligation-requirements-if-youre-55-or-older?context=60070), you may have different mutual obligation requirements.

If you’re getting [Disability Support Pension](/meeting-participation-requirements-if-youre-under-35) and are under 35, you have [participation requirements](/meeting-participation-requirements-if-youre-under-35).

### Meeting mutual obligation requirements while home schooling

Home schooling may affect your ability to meet your [mutual obligation requirements](/meeting-your-obligations-when-you-look-for-work?context=60070) if you’re getting certain income support payments from us.

If you’re a principal carer, and home schooling a dependent child, you may be exempt from these requirements. The exemption may be granted for up to 12 months at a time. Read more about [exemptions from mutual obligation requirements for principal carers](/exemptions-from-mutual-obligation-requirements-for-principal-carers#homeschooling).

## Meeting your requirements

To meet your requirements, you’ll need to regularly report your income to us and mutual obligation requirements to your employment services provider. If you’re self-managing through Workforce Australia Online, you can do this via your homepage on the [Workforce Australia](https://www.workforceaustralia.gov.au/) website.

If you’re referred to Workforce Australia, you may have to reach your points target each month to meet your requirements. You’ll earn points by doing tasks and activities.

The number of points you need to reach each month is based on your personal circumstances and local labour market conditions.

If you’re with a provider, they’ll set the monthly points target based on your personal circumstances.

Read more about your [points target](https://www.workforceaustralia.gov.au/individuals/obligations/learn/points) on the Workforce Australia website.

If you’re in Inclusive Employment Australia or in the Remote Australia Employment Service, you don’t have a points target.

This line may be closed on some public holidays. Read about [public holiday closures, reporting and payment arrangements](/public-holiday-reporting-and-payment-dates).

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income.
