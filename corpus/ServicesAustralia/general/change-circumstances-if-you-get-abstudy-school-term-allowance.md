# Change of circumstances

You need to tell us if your circumstances change when you get ABSTUDY School Term Allowance.

## on this page

-   [What to tell us](#a1)
-   [How to tell us](#a2)

## What to tell us

You need to tell us if any of the following things change:

-   your personal and contact details
-   your bank details
-   you’re [leaving the country](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-abstudy?context=53272), temporarily or to live somewhere else
-   your child changes schools or lives with someone else.

You need to tell us about a change in your circumstances within 14 days. If you don’t, we may pay you too much. This means you’ll have a [debt](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments) you need to pay back.

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us about changes to your circumstances online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also tell us using either:

-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [Centrelink phone self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option please call the [ABSTUDY line](#toolbar-phone).

Contact numbers available on this page.
