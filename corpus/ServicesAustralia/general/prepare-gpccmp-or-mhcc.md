# Prepare a GPCCMP or MHCC

Prepare a GP chronic condition management plan (GPCCMP) or case conferences.

Care plans help you coordinate care and reduce ad hoc consultations. They’re useful for recording comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date information about a patient’s condition and treatment. Developing a care plan can also help patients identify things they could do to achieve the treatment goals.

If your patient has a health care plan for chronic condition, you can deliver care plan services using any of the following:

-   GP chronic condition management plan (GPCCMP)
-   Multidisciplinary case conference (MCC).

If your patient has a health care plan for an eating disorder, you can deliver care plan services using any of the following:

-   Eating disorder treatment and management plan (EDP)
-   Mental health case conference (MHCC).

If your patient has a health care plan for mental health, you can deliver care plan services using any or the following:

-   Mental health treatment plan (MHTP)
-   Mental health case conference (MHCC).

You can lookup patient eligibility for Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers through the [MBS items online checker in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS](/check-mbs-item-numbers?context=20)).

Learn about [MBS item descriptions, fact sheets and explanatory notes](https://www.mbsonline.gov.au/) on the MBS Online website.

GP chronic condition management plan (GPCCMP)

When preparing a GPCCMP you should:

-   explain the steps involved in preparing the plan to your patient
-   record their agreement to proceed.

Then write a plan that describes:

-   your patient’s health care needs, health problems and relevant conditions
-   management goals and actions for your patient
-   the treatment and services your patient will need
-   arrangements for providing the treatment and services
-   arrangements to review the GPCCMP.

Once your patient agrees to their GPCCMP, offer them a copy and add a copy to their medical record.

Mental health case conference (MHCC)

When coordinating the MHCC, discuss all of the following with your patient:

-   The steps involved in developing the MHCC.
-   The multidisciplinary team who’ll contribute to the MHCC and provide treatments and services.
-   Your patient’s agreement to proceed, noting their response in their medical records.

When documenting the MHCC, include:

-   treatment and service goals for your patient
-   treatment and services that collaborating health professionals have agreed to
-   actions for your patient
-   review dates.

Once you’ve completed the MHCC document:

-   offer a copy of it to your patient
-   give copies of the relevant parts of the document to collaborating health professionals
-   add a copy of the document to your patient’s medical record.
