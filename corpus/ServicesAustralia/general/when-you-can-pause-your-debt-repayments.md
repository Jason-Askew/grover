## If you’re affected by a disaster or emergency event

If you’re affected by a declared disaster or significant emergency event, you can pause or change your debt repayments online. You can pause or change your debt repayments twice in a 12 month period. If you don’t, your repayments will continue as normal.

If you’ve subscribed to [electronic messaging](/electronic-messaging), we’ll send you a text message about pausing or changing your debt repayments. We’ll do this if you live in an area impacted by a disaster or emergency event.

You can also pause or change your debt repayments online within 14 days of being granted a crisis or hardship payment.

We keep investigating overpayments during and after a disaster or emergency event. We’ll contact you if you’ve been overpaid and need to repay a debt. You can manage your repayment choices based on what’s best for your situation.
