## Why we need medical evidence

We need to know how your disability or medical condition affects you. This will help us work out if you can get DSP.

Watch our video about getting medical evidence for DSP.

We need medical evidence from your treating doctors or other health professionals. In most cases, we need current evidence for each condition that affects your ability to work.

Give us all your medical evidence with your claim so we can assess it faster. It should support what you’ve put in the medical details section of your claim form.

If you don’t give us evidence, we may either:

-   reject your claim
-   stop your payment.

If you’re having problems getting evidence, [call us](#toolbar-phone). We can talk with you about your options.

## What we need to know

Your medical evidence should tell us any of the following:

-   your diagnosed disability or medical conditions
-   past, current and planned treatment
-   how your condition impacts you day to day
-   the names and contact details of your treating doctors.

### Your symptoms

This helps us know any of the following:

-   when the symptoms started
-   how often and for how long the symptoms happen
-   the impact of your conditions with treatment and use of aids, equipment or assistive technology.

### Your prognosis

We need to know how long your condition will last and if it:

-   will improve, stay the same, or get worse
-   may affect how long you’ll live.

## What types of medical evidence you need to give us

The evidence we need depends on your disability or medical condition. For some conditions or situations we need particular information.

### Manifest medical rules

Your condition

Specialist medical evidence we need

Why we need this

Mental health conditions

Evidence showing either:

-   a psychiatrist diagnosed your condition
-   a registered or clinical psychologist supports your treating doctor’s diagnosis.

This helps us [assess your impairment](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) against Table 5 of the DSS Impairment Tables.

We can only do this where the condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

If your DSP claim start date or medical review was before 1 April 2023 you need to provide either:

-   medical evidence showing a psychiatrist diagnosis
-   evidence that a clinical psychologist supported your treating doctor’s diagnosis.

Intellectual disability

Evidence showing an assessment of intellectual function and adaptive behaviour by a psychologist.

This helps us [assess your impairment](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) against Table 9 of the DSS Impairment Tables.

We can only do this where the condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

Ear conditions affecting hearing or balance

Evidence showing both:

-   the diagnosis has been made by a qualified medical practitioner
-   an audiologist or an ear, nose and throat specialist supports the diagnosis.

This helps us [assess your impairment](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) against Table 11 of the DSS Impairment Tables.

We can only do this where the condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

Eye conditions affecting vision

Evidence showing an ophthalmologist or ophthalmic surgeon supports the diagnosis.

This helps us [assess your impairment](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) against Table 12 of the DSS Impairment Tables.

We can only do this where the condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
