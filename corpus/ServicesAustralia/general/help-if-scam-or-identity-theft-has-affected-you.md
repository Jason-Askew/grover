Our staff can help if a Services Australia or myGov scam has affected you, including identity theft.

There’s also help available if you’re affected by any other type of scam, identity misuse or cyber security threats.

## If you’ve been scammed

We can help if you’ve been affected by a scam impersonating myGov or Services Australia, including Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support. You can also report scams pretending to be us to help protect others.

Call our [Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk](#toolbar-phone) if you’ve done any of the following:

-   opened a link in a suspicious text message, email or social media message
-   given someone your myGov sign in details or other personal information
-   visited a website that pretended to be us or downloaded a fake app.

Our staff can also support you if:

-   you’ve had your identity documents or myGov, Centrelink or Medicare information exposed in a third-party data breach
-   you’re a victim of identity theft.

The helpdesk can:

-   offer support and advice about how to protect yourself and your personal information
-   check your customer records for any suspicious activity
-   make corrections to your records if needed
-   add extra security measures to prevent unauthorised access.

We can have an interpreter on the line if you need help in your language.

You can also call our Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk using the National Relay Service (NRS). Find out more [about the NRS](https://www.accesshub.gov.au/about-the-nrs) on Access Hub on the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts website.

## If your identity has been stolen

Identity crime is when someone gets access to your personal information to steal money or gain other benefits. Stolen personal information can be physical or digital and often includes:

-   Identity documents
-   Medicare cards
-   utility bills
-   insurance renewals
-   medical records.

You may experience identity theft in any of the following situations:

-   your digital personal information is stolen after someone accesses your online services, like an email, banking account or Centrelink online account
-   your digital personal information is exposed or illegally sold due to a third-party data breach
-   your physical identity documents or personal information is stolen from your wallet, letterbox or rubbish.

Read more about [protecting your personal information after a data breach](/protecting-your-personal-information-after-data-breach?context=60271). Our Scams and Identity Theft Helpdesk staff can support you if:

-   you’re a victim of identity theft
-   you’re worried you could be at risk of identity theft
-   you’ve had your identity documents or myGov, Centrelink or Medicare information exposed in a third-party data breach.

## If you’ve received a letter about a data breach

A notifiable data breach means someone has accessed the personal information in your Centrelink record. A data breach can be caused by a malicious attack, system fault, staff error or scam.

We sent you this letter because we found potential unauthorised access or changes to your Centrelink record. We believe the potential unauthorised access or changes were made by someone else without your permission.

When you get this letter, it’s important you check your details are correct and look for any changes you didn’t make on your Centrelink record.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to check your details and recent activity.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you notice unauthorised activity, call our [Online Services Support Hotline](/phone-us#mygovhelp) for help.

Read more about [scams and identity theft](/scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271).

Under the _Privacy Act 1988_, we’re required to notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, as well as anyone who has been affected, of a notifiable data breach. If you’re affected, we’ll send you a letter with more information about what you should do and how we’re protecting your details. Based on your preferences, we’ll send this letter to you by post or to your myGov Inbox.

The privacy and security of your personal information is important to us and is protected by law. You have a right to have your personal information kept private. Read more about [your right to privacy](/your-right-to-privacy?context=22).
