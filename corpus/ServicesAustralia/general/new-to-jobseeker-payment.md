-   [What support is available for job seekers in remote areas](#a3)

We’ll send you a letter in the mail about the outcome of your JobSeeker Payment claim. If it’s approved, you’ll need to do a few things before you’ll get your first payment.

## What you need to do

To get your payment, you’ll need to report every 2 weeks and complete a Job Plan. You may also need to complete a Career Profile, we’ll let you know if you need to do this in the letter.

If there’s any [changes in your circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-jobseeker-payment?context=51411), you must tell us.

### Completing your report

To get your payment, you need to report every 2 weeks. You need to do this even if you and your partner don’t work, or you work but haven’t been paid yet.

You’ll need to tell us about any employment income you and your partner were paid in that period. After you’ve reported the first time, you may see [employment details pre-filled when you report](/when-we-pre-fill-your-information?context=51411) again.

If you worked but your employer hasn’t paid you yet, you can report your hours. You won’t get your payment until you finalise your report.

The easiest way to report is online. You can also find out what day you need to report.

To do this you need a Centrelink online account linked to myGov. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

### Agree to a Job Plan and meet your requirements

Your Job Plan is an agreement you make to meet your [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=51411).

If we approve your claim, you’ll need to complete a Job Plan. There’re different ways to do this, depending on your circumstances.

If you’re with an employment services provider, you’ll need to complete your Job Plan at your first appointment with them.

If you’re with Workforce Australia Online, you’ll need to agree to your Job Plan online. You can access this in your Centrelink online account.
