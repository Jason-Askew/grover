# Sustainability

We support the Australian Government to reduce the impact we have on the environment.

## Net zero action plan

The Australian Government is committed to acting on climate change in its own operations.

Our net zero action plan outlines how we’ll support the Commonwealth to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in government operations by 2030. These steps include:

-   using renewable energy
-   improving building standards
-   switching our vehicles to low emission options
-   installing LED lighting and solar upgrades
-   buying from sustainable sources
-   publicly reporting our emissions each year in our annual report.
