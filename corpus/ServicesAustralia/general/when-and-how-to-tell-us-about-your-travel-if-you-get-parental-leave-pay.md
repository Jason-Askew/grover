# When and how to tell us about your travel

When you get Parental Leave Pay, you may need to tell us if you’re leaving Australia.

## When to tell us about your travel

You need to tell us if you’re leaving Australia and any of the following apply, you:

-   are going to live in another country
-   will be away for more than 6 weeks
-   haven’t been back in Australia for at least 6 weeks since you last returned
-   are leaving temporarily but for more than 56 weeks
-   hold a [partner provisional visa](/residence-descriptions?context=64479#ppv) or [temporary protection type visa](/residence-descriptions?context=64479#tptv)
-   are going without your child, or they are going without you, on a nominated Parental Leave Pay day.

You can only access Parental Leave Pay on days you’re providing care for your child. This means you can’t claim a day if either of the following apply:

-   you’re outside Australia without your child
-   your child is outside Australia without you.

Exceptions apply. For example, you may be eligible for Parental Leave Pay days if you’re temporarily unable to care for your child due to circumstances beyond your control, such as when you have to travel overseas for a crisis or medical treatment.

We must be satisfied you would be caring for your child except for the temporary inability to care.

## How to tell us about your travel

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to tell us about your travel plans.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

We may ask you for supporting documents about your travel. If we do, you should give us your evidence supporting documents before you leave Australia. The documents you need to provide depend on your circumstances. If you don’t give us the evidence before you leave Australia, your payment may stop when you depart. If we’ve stopped your payment, we’ll reassess it once we get your supporting documents.

You can do this via your Centrelink online account through myGov. You can also use your online account to get information on how your travel could affect your payments and concession cards.

You can call the [Centrelink families line](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your circumstances further.
