# Track the progress of your FTB balancing

You can track your Family Tax Benefit (FTB) balancing in the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

When you open the app, select **Profile**, followed by **Financial details** from the menu. Your balancing status will display in the Family Tax Benefit section as either:

-   in progress
-   complete.

You’ll have the option to click on **FTB Balancing** for more information.

If your balancing is in progress, it means we haven’t finished balancing your FTB.

If it's showing as complete it may mean your outcome is ready to view. Once your FTB balancing is complete, we’ll send you a letter with your outcome.

## When your outcome is complete and we’re checking your information

In some cases, your status may show as complete, but we may need to check with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to see if any of the following apply:

-   you have a tax debt and owe them money
-   you have a tax refund that can be used to repay a debt with us
-   we’ve received an amended tax return from the ATO that needs to be checked.

If you owe us or the ATO any money, your top up or any supplements you’re eligible for may be used to pay these back first. Once it’s complete and we’ve checked with the ATO, we’ll send you a letter with your outcome.
