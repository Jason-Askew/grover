## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with nintedanib under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 for patients with PF-ILD.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing nintedanib.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with nintedanib, patients must be diagnosed through a multidisciplinary team and be treated either:

-   by a respiratory physician or specialist physician
-   in consultation with a respiratory physician or specialist physician.

A multidisciplinary team includes at least a specialist respiratory physician, a radiologist and where histological material is considered, a pathologist.

If attendance isn’t possible because of geographical isolation, consultation with a multidisciplinary team is required for diagnosis.
