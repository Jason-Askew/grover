# While you wait

There are some things you can do while you wait to hear about your Carer Payment claim.

## on this page

-   [Checking where your claim is up to](#a1)
-   [Accessing other help](#a2)

Carer situations are complex and it will take some time to assess your situation.

We’ll contact you if we need any more information to support your claim so we can fully understand your situation and the support you need.

We’ll never ask you for money to release your information or fix your account. Read more about [How to protect against scams](/how-to-protect-against-scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271).

## Checking where your claim is up to

To check where your claim is up to you can use:

-   your [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account) using your [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)

You can also use your online account to:

-   check messages from us
-   update your details and tell us of any changes
-   withdraw your application.
