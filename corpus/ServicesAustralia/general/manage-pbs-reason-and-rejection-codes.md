# Manage PBS reason and rejection codes

Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) approved suppliers reason and rejection codes for online claiming.

If there’s an issue with your Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claim, you may get an automated reason code sent to your system.

Sometimes you won’t need to do anything. Other times you’ll need to fix the issue and re-submit your PBS claim using your provider software.

There are 4 types of reason codes:

-   R - rejection
-   W - warning
-   I - information
-   X - time-based warning, returned as a warning (W) for a set time period. After this time the reason code will be returned as a rejection (R).

If you need more information contact [PBS general enquiries](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#pbsgeneral). For enquiries about Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) claims, contact the [Veterans’ Affairs Pharmaceutical Advisory Centre](https://www.dva.gov.au/providers/information-for-gps-other-primary-care-providers/medicines/pharmacy-information-for-providers#veterans-affairs-pharmaceutical-advisory-centre).

It’s important you understand what you need to do when you get a code from us.

Use the filter box. Enter the code or keywords from the code message.
