# Income and assets tests

The amount of Parenting Payment you can get depends on your income and assets as well as your partner’s, if you have one.

-   [How much income you can have before it affects your payment](#a2)
-   [Income changes](#a3)
-   [Income types](#a4)
-   [Assets test](#a5)

Use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to work out how much Parenting Payment you may be able to get.

There are limits to the amount of income you can earn. We review income limits on 20 March, 1 July and 20 September each year.

## How we assess income

We use your fortnightly income to work out your payment. If you have a partner, we also use their income.

We generally use the gross amount in the income test. This is the amount before tax or any other deductions. For some types of income such as from a business or real estate, we use the net amount.

If you get Parenting Payment and you don’t [report](/employment-income-reporting?context=22196) your and your partner’s income to us, you may be overpaid. This means you could get a debt.

## How much income you can have before it affects your payment

You can have income up to a certain amount before we reduce your payment.

If your income is above the cut-off point, we won’t pay your Parenting Payment.

### If you’re single

The income you can have before we reduce your payment depends on how many children you have.

Your payment will reduce by 40 cents for every dollar of income you have over the income amount listed in this table.

Income per fortnight before your payment starts to reduce

Number of children

Income per fortnight before your payment starts to reduce

1

$224.60

2

$249.20

3

$273.80

More than 3

$273.80 plus $24.60 for each extra child

If your income is over the cut-off point of $2,841.35 a fortnight, we pay you $0 for that fortnight. The cut-off point increases by $24.60 per child if you have more than one child.

If you’re [Age Pension](/age-pension) age or older, the income limit may be different.

### If you have a partner

Your partner either:

-   gets a payment that’s not a pension, for example JobSeeker Payment
-   doesn’t get an income support payment from us.

We assess your and your partner’s income separately.

## Income changes

If you or your partner are paid any income, you need to tell us before your next payment. You must tell us either:

-   on your regular reporting day when you’re [scheduled to report your income](/employment-income-reporting?context=22196)
-   within 14 days if you’re not scheduled to report.

This is so we can pay you and your partner the right amount and to help you avoid a debt.

If you get Family Tax Benefit or Child Care Subsidy you may also need to update your [family income estimate when your income changes](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments).

## Income types

Most types of income count towards your income limit. Find out more about [income types](/income?context=22196).

## Assets test

There are limits to how much your assets can be worth. You won’t be eligible for payment if your and your partners assets, if you have one, are over the asset test limit.

Some items and property can affect your Parenting Payment. You and your partner’s assets include:

-   items and property you or your partner own in full or part
-   items and property you or your partner have an interest in
-   any debts owed to you and your partner
-   any assets overseas.

Your payment will cancel when your assets are more than the following amounts. The income limit still applies.
