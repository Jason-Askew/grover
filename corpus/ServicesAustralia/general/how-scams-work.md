Call us for [help in your language](/phone-us#languages).

Scammers use different methods to trick you, including through:

-   phone calls
-   emails
-   text messages
-   social media
-   fake websites or ads.

## How phishing scams work

Scammers often use phishing scams to try to trick you into giving away your personal information. Sometimes they pretend to be myGov, Centrelink, Medicare or other government departments such as the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). They may also pretend to be from your bank.

Scammers can contact lots of people at the same time. You may know this as spam.

Don’t open any links or attachments in messages or emails pretending to be us. If you open a link or attachment, it might take you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Find out more about [how to protect against scams and identity theft](/how-to-protect-against-scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271).

There are things you can do if you’re the victim of a scam or identity theft, including if your details are exposed in a third party data breach. Find out more about [how you can protect your personal information after a data breach](/how-you-can-protect-your-personal-information-after-data-breach?context=60271).

-   date of birth
-   phone number and email address

They also want personal information that you hold with us, including your:

-   myGov sign in details
-   Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN)
-   Medicare card number.

## What scammers do with your information

If a scammer has information about the records you hold with us, such as your myGov sign in details, they can:

-   update your records to steal your payments or refunds
