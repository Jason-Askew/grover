# Corrective Services

Correctional centres help people in prison to access forms and products.

We have forms and products to help people entering or leaving prison. You may need to help our customers and submit these forms on their behalf.

## eKit

You can use our Corrective Services eKit to help support people with our services while they’re in prison.

[Download the Corrective Services eKit](/sites/default/files/2025-04/corrective-services-ekit.zip "Zip download. Zip download")

The eKit includes:

-   posters
-   factsheet
-   a guide on how to use the eKit.

By using this eKit, you agree to use our resources in the exact form we provide them. Please don’t change the designs in any way.
