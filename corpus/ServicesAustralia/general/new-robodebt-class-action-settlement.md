The notice describes the new settlement and the steps you need to take if you want to register.

If you don’t receive a notice from us, you can still register for the new settlement. A copy of the notice is available on this page.

We have [information available](/avoid-and-report-scams?context=60271#checkifgenuine) to help you check if communication from us is genuine and not a scam.

## How to register for the new settlement

You need to register to receive a new settlement payment. It’s free to register.

You need to do this even if you were a group member for the original settlement.

You may be eligible for a new settlement payment even if you didn’t receive a payment as part of the original settlement.

Gordon Legal is managing the registration process for the new settlement. You can register through the [Group Member Registration Information Portal](https://www.robodebtsettlement.com.au/) on Gordon Legal’s class action settlement website. You can also register by submitting a form to Gordon Legal or by calling them.

Eligible group members will have 14 weeks to register for a settlement payment. Registrations will close on 6 March 2026.

Eligibility for the new settlement scheme, claim assessment and payment calculation will be determined by the scheme administrator. The Federal Court will appoint the scheme administrator later.

If you have questions about the new robodebt class action settlement, contact Gordon Legal by telephone on 1300 001 356 or by email at [robodebt@gordonlegal.com.au](mailto:robodebt@gordonlegal.com.au).

It’s free to ask Gordon Legal questions about the class action settlement. If you call Gordon Legal, some call costs may apply.

## Information about the new settlement

The robodebt class action was originally settled in 2021. In 2022, approximately $112 million in settlement payments was distributed to group members.

In September 2024, Gordon Legal appealed this settlement.

The Commonwealth and the applicants, represented by Gordon Legal, have agreed to a new settlement.

The new settlement still needs to be approved by the Federal Court. We expect the Federal Court will be asked to approve the settlement in mid-2026.

If the new settlement is approved, the Commonwealth will pay an additional $475 million as compensation for the harm caused to eligible group members.

The new settlement will include an amount up to $13.5 million for the applicants’ reasonable legal costs as determined by the Federal Court.

The new settlement will also include an amount up to $60 million for the reasonable costs of administering the settlement scheme as determined by the Federal Court.

This new settlement is in addition to the original settlement payments made in 2022 and the debts that were refunded or have been zeroed.
