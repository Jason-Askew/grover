# When you get lump sum compensation

If you get lump sum compensation, it can affect income support payments you get from us.

A lump sum payment is usually made at the end of a claim for compensation, through a settlement agreement or a court decision. It can be for a personal injury that leads to loss of income.

You may be able to make a claim for compensation if you’ve been injured because of one of the following:

-   a work-related accident or illness
-   a car accident
-   an injury due to the negligence or fault of another person.

You may be eligible for an [income support payment](/income-support-payment?context=60271) while you wait for your compensation claim to be settled.

If you get a compensation lump sum payment for loss of income, your income support payments from us may stop. You may need to repay us for past income support payments made to you.

[

Preclusion periods

If you get lump sum compensation, you won’t be able to get income support payments for a certain time. It may also affect other payments or cards you get from us.
