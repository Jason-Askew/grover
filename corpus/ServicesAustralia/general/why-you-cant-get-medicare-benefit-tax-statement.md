# Why you can’t get one

The Net Medical Expenses Tax Offset is being phased out.

From 2015-16 until 2018-19, claims for this offset only apply to expenses that relate to either:

-   disability aids
-   attendant carer
-   aged care.

As you can’t claim these expenses through Medicare, we won’t issue you a statement for these.
