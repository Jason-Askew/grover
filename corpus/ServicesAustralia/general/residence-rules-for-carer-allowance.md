# Residence rules

To be eligible for Carer Allowance you must meet the residence rules.

On the day you claim, you must be all of the following:

-   [living in Australia](/residence-descriptions?context=21811#livinginaustralia)
-   physically in Australia
-   an [Australian resident](/residence-descriptions?context=21811#ausresident).

The person you are caring for must be:

-   living in Australia
-   an Australian resident.

To keep getting your payment, you must both be living in Australia as Australian residents.

## When you need to wait

If you've recently arrived as a resident in Australia, you may have to wait one year to get this payment. There are some exemptions to this. Read more about the [newly arrived resident’s waiting period](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=21811).
