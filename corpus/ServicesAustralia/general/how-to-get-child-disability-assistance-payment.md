# How to get it

You don’t need to claim for Child Disability Assistance Payment. If you’re eligible, we’ll pay it straight into your bank account.

If you haven’t got Child Disability Assistance Payment by **early August** and you think you’re eligible, you can follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Payments and claims**, followed by **Manage payments** and **My payments** and check to see if we’ve paid you.
3.  Check the bank account details you told us are correct.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If the payment isn’t showing, call our [Disability, sickness and carers line](/phone-us#peoplewithdisability).
