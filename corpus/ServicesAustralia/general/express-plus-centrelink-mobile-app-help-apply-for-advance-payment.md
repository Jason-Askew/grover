-   sign in to their own account on the app
-   select **More** from their home screen, then **Nominee access**.

Depending on the type of advance, you can get your advance payment as either:

-   one instalment
-   2 instalments.

If you want us to pay you in 2 instalments, you’ll need to tell us:

-   the amount of your first instalment
-   the date you would like the second instalment.

In this example, we’ll choose to be paid in 2 instalments. Select **Yes**, then **Next**.

If you’re applying for a Family Tax Benefit advance, we can only pay this in one instalment.
