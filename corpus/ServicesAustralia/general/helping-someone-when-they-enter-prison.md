# Helping someone when they enter prison

Corrective services can help our customers update their details with us when they enter prison.

When a person enters prison, they need to notify us of changes to their circumstances.

They can contact us on the dedicated prison phone line to:

-   update their details
-   confirm their imprisonment
-   suspend their payment
-   arrange for their final payment
-   set up a nominee.

If they can’t contact us on the prison phone line, they may need help to submit a form. To update their details and suspend their payment, they can use the [Confirmation of imprisonment and application for payment form](/su709). This is to stop them being paid the wrong amount and getting a debt.

## Set up a nominee or representative

Our customer may set up a nominee to complete their Centrelink, Medicare and child support business on their behalf when they have entered prison.

### Centrelink nominee

They may want to nominate someone or an organisation to act on their behalf with Centrelink while they’re in prison, this is called a nominee arrangement. Use the [Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf form](/ss313).

### Medicare representative

To nominate a person or organisation to act on their behalf with Medicare while they’re in prison, use the [Authorisation to act on an incapacitated person’s behalf for Medicare purposes form](/mo050).

### Child support representative

They can authorise a person or organisation to enquire or act on their behalf for child support while they’re in prison, use the [Representative authority form](/cs3042).
