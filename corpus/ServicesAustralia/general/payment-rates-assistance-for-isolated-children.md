# Payment rates

The amount of Assistance for Isolated Children you get depends on the student's living arrangements during the school year and number of eligible children in your family.

The amount of Additional Boarding Allowance you can get depends on parental income and the boarding fees you pay for the child.

In some cases, payment will be made based on how many days the child meets eligibility or is in your care. We refer to this as getting payment on a pro-rata basis.

We adjust payment rates on 1 January each year in line with increases in the cost of living. This doesn’t apply to the Assistance for Isolated Children Pensioner Education Supplement.
