# Royal Commission into Robodebt

Learn about Services Australia’s role in relation to the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme.

## About the Royal Commission

The Royal Commission was established on 18 August 2022 and inquired into the debt assessment and recovery scheme commonly known as Robodebt. It was an independent inquiry supported by its own staff and was not managed by Services Australia.

The Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme was a separate process to the [robodebt class action](/robodebt-class-action?context=60271) and [robodebt refunds](/robodebt-refunds?context=60271).

The Royal Commission delivered a final report with its findings to the Governor-General on 7 July 2023.

The final report is published on the [Royal Commission’s website](https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/).

The Australian Government published its response to the Royal Commission report on 13 November 2023. You can read the full response on the [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet website](https://www.pmc.gov.au/resources/government-response-royal-commission-robodebt-scheme).

If matters raised by the Royal Commission cause you any distress you can call Lifeline at any time on 13 11 14. Dedicated crisis support is available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians by calling 13 YARN (13 92 76).
