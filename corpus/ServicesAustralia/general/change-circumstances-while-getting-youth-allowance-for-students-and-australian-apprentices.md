You can also tell us using either:

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option please call the [youth and students line](#toolbar-phone).

If you don’t tell us, it may affect your payment. You may need to pay back money we’ve paid you. If you’re dishonest in order to get a payment, you’re committing fraud. Read more about [how to avoid committing fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud).

Here are some examples of changes you must tell us about.

## Study

You need to tell us about any changes to your study. This includes if:

-   you don’t stay enrolled in your course
-   you stop studying and don’t plan to return to study
-   you stop being a full time Australian Apprentice
-   you don’t start your course within 2 weeks of the course start date
-   you change your course
-   you start studying at a different institution
-   you reduce your study or training workload
-   you’re no longer getting a STARTUP-HELP loan for your Startup Year course.

## Employment and income

You need to tell us about any changes to your employment or income. This includes if:

-   you start or stop work
-   you change your work hours or change jobs
-   you get compensation, leave or redundancy payments
-   you [start or stop getting a scholarship (bursary, stipend or grant)](/income-from-scholarships-for-students-and-apprentices?context=43916)

-   you buy or sell a car, house or other assets.

### What a nil rate payment period is

You enter a nil rate payment period when you report employment income and if both apply:

-   your Income Bank credit balance is zero
-   your total income is over the maximum income before your payment reaches to $0.

You can have up to 12 fortnights in a row of $0 payment before we’ll suspend or cancel your payment.

Your total income includes:

-   your income
-   your partner’s income
-   your combined income.

If we pay you at least $1 before the end of the 12 fortnights, we won’t suspend or cancel your payment.

You must continue to report your income fortnightly to us so we can apply the nil rate payment period. If you have a partner, this applies to their income as well.

We’ll automatically restart your payments if the total income reported is both:

-   below the maximum income before your payment reduces to $0
-   within the nil rate payment period.

If you’re getting a supplementary benefit or hold a concession card, these won’t be affected in a nil rate payment period.

To learn more about how your income affects your payment, read about the [income test for Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices](/income-and-assets-tests-for-youth-allowance-for-student-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916).

You can find more information about [Income Bank](/income-bank).
