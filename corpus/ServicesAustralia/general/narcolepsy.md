## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with armodafinil and modafinil under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 for patients with narcolepsy.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing armodafinil and modafinil.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with these medicines, patients must be treated by a qualified sleep medicine practitioner or a neurologist.

Armodafinil and modafinil are not PBS-subsidised when used in combination with each other or with PBS-subsidised dexamfetamine sulfate.
