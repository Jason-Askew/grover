# How it works

Income Management in Bankstown, New South Wales helps you manage your payments for essentials like food, rent and bills.

You do not get less money, but you do get it differently. Part of your payment goes to an Income Management account and the rest goes into your normal bank account.

You cannot use your income managed money to buy any of the following:

-   alcoholic products
-   tobacco products
-   pornography
-   gambling products and services
-   homebrew kits or concentrates.

You can spend the rest of your money how you like.
