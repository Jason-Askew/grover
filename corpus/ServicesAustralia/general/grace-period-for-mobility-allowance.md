# Grace period

If you stop your qualifying activity, you may still get Mobility Allowance for a short time. This is known as a grace period.

The standard grace period is 2 or 12 weeks, depending on your individual circumstances.

If you’re still in a grace period and you start a qualifying activity again, contact us on the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone).

Qualifying activities include:

-   work
-   training
-   looking for work.

If your grace period has finished, depending on your circumstances, one of these may happen:

-   your Mobility Allowance payment will stop
-   your Mobility Allowance rate will reduce, if you were getting the higher rate.

If your payment stops, you can claim again if you’re eligible.

Contact numbers available on this page.
