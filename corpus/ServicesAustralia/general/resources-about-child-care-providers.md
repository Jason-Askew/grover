## Compliance

All approved child care services must comply with the law. If they don’t, they can’t get Child Care Subsidy on behalf of a family.

Read more about the [Child Care Financial Integrity Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/early-childhood/resources/child-care-financial-integrity-strategy) on the Department of Education website.

## Regulations

Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA) works with states and territories. They work together to assess children’s education and care services.

This includes overseeing the National Quality Framework (NQF). This is the national system for the regulation and quality assessment of approved child care services.

Read more about [regulatory authorities](https://www.acecqa.gov.au/help/contact-your-regulatory-authority) in each state and territory. You can also read about the [NQF](https://www.acecqa.gov.au/nqf/about) on the ACECQA website.

## Feedback

You can provide feedback relating to your child care service. [Make a complaint](https://www.education.gov.au/about-department/contact-us/complaints) using the online complaint form on the Department of Education website.
