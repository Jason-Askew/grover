## myGov user audit

In 2022 [an independent user audit of myGov](https://ministers.dss.gov.au/media-releases/9126) was announced.

In this audit, a panel looked at how well myGov was performing for Australians when it comes to reliability, functionality and delivering a user-friendly experience. The report has been submitted to government and will be used to help inform future improvements to myGov.

You can read the summaries or the full [audit report](https://my.gov.au/en/audit) on the myGov website.
