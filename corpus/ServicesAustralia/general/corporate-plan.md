# Corporate plan

The corporate plan sets our direction for 2025-26. It shows how we'll continue to deliver our commitments to the Australian Government and the community.

Our corporate plan is the primary planning document for our agency and is informed by the [Services Australia 2030 Vision](/services-australia-2030-vision?context=22) and the [Services Australia 2030 Strategy](/services-australia-2030-strategy?context=22).

It’s a 4-year plan that sets out:

-   our purpose and strategic outlook
-   the key activities we’ll undertake to achieve our purpose
-   the environment in which we operate
-   the capabilities we’ll build on
-   how we’ll measure and assess our performance in achieving our purpose.
