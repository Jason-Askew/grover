## Repaying money you owe

You’ll need to repay the money you owe in full or set up a repayment arrangement with us by the due date. Most people set up a repayment arrangement and pay it over an agreed period of time.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to set up a repayment arrangement.

You can also set up a repayment arrangement by either:

-   using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [calling us](/phone-us).

At any time, you can also [make extra payments](/if-youre-ready-to-start-repaying-money-you-owe?context=60271) towards the amount you owe. This may be a regular payment or a one-off payment.

## Taking money from your tax refund

In some situations, we may use your tax refund to repay your debt. This is known as a tax garnishee. Read more about [how we recover debts at tax time](/how-we-recover-debts-tax-time?context=60271).
