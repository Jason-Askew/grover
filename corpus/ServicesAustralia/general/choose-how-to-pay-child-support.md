# Choose how to pay child support

There are different ways to pay child support or spousal maintenance.

Changes to how you make child support payments using the app

You can no longer use your Express Plus app to make child support payments. Pay by card using your Child Support online account through [myGov](http://my.gov.au).

Select your payment or service to find out how this impacts you:
