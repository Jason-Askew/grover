# How we work out your assessment

How we assess the amount of child support you need to pay or receive. The formula we use to work it out is in Australian law.

[

The assessment formula

The child support assessment formula looks at your circumstances to work out how much child support should be paid.

[

Basic formula

This formula is for parents with only one child support assessment.

[

Your percentage of care may affect your payment

We consider each parent or non-parent carer’s care of the child as part of our child support assessment. This is their percentage of care.
