# How much you can get

The amount of ABSTUDY Living Allowance you can get depends on certain circumstances.

These include all of the following:

-   whether you’re a secondary, tertiary, masters or doctorate student
-   whether you’re [dependent or independent](/dependent-or-independent-for-abstudy?context=45541)
-   whether you’re approved to [live away from home](/higher-rates-abstudy-living-allowance-when-living-away-from-home?context=45541)
-   how old you are
-   if you have a partner
-   the results of the [personal income test for you](/income-and-assets-tests-for-abstudy?context=45541#personalincome) and the [partner income test](/income-and-assets-tests-for-abstudy?context=45541#partnerincome)
-   the results of a [parental means test](/income-and-assets-tests-for-abstudy?context=45541#parentalincome) for your parents or guardians
-   if you have a dependent child or children in your care.

ABSTUDY Living Allowance if you’re 16 or older is a taxable Centrelink payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=45541).
