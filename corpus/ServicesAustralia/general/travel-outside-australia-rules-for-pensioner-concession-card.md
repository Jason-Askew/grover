For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you leave Australia to live in another country, we’ll cancel your card when you depart.

If you travel for a short term, your card will remain current for up to 6 weeks. But you must be getting your main payment. If your main payment stops, we’ll cancel your card.

Check the travel rules for your main [payment while outside Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22006) to find out:

-   if you can get your payment when you depart
-   when and how to tell us about your travel plans.

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.
