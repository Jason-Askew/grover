# Check your exchange rate

If you get a reduced rate of pension due to your foreign income and assets, we’ll send you a letter in February each year. This will tell you the exchange rates we used for the past 12 months. You don’t need to do anything when you get this letter.

## Less common currencies

To check less common currencies or rates used more than 2 months ago call our [Older Australians Line](#toolbar-phone).

## Asking us to reassess

You can ask us to review an exchange rate if there’s more than 5% difference between both:

-   the rate we used
-   the actual rate an organisation or bank used to change your income or assets into Australian dollars.

You need to show us proof of that rate.

Contact numbers available on this page.
