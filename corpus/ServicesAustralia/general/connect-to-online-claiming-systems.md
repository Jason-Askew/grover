Register to do business online

Before you start, check your software is compatible. View our list of [software developers for practice software](/practice-software?context=20).

Contact your software developer to make sure they can support your online needs such as bulk billing or private patient claims. Your software developer can:

-   give you a minor ID unique to your location, used to complete the Provider Digital Access (PRODA) organisation linking process
-   make sure the health professionals working from your location complete the [online claiming provider agreement form (HW027)](/hw027?context=20)
-   tell you if you need to [register your organisation](/how-to-register-organisation-proda) in PRODA and complete the [online linking process](/adding-and-linking-to-health-service-providers).

If you need help with your online claiming registration, call the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

You need consent to register on behalf of health professionals in your practice and to access their Medicare provider records. The health professionals must sign the [online claiming provider agreement form (HW027)](/hw027?context=20).

Maintain your online claiming details

It’s important to keep your details, including your address, phone numbers and bank details, up to date. This is so we can contact you and send important information as needed.

You can easily do this in one of the following ways:

-   in [Health Professionals Online System (HPOS)](/hpos?context=20)
-   with the [banking details online claiming form (HW052)](/hw052?context=20)
-   by calling the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

Registration checklist

To connect your practice online with us, make sure of all of the following:

-   your software developer has confirmed your operating system and software can do what you need
-   you’ve spoken to your software developer and confirmed your minor ID and if you require a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) individual or a PRODA organisation account or both
-   you have linked your PRODA organisation account with a service in PRODA called ‘Medicare Online/ECLIPSE/DVA/AIR’
-   all health professionals in the practice have completed and signed the [online claiming provider agreement form (HW027)](/hw027?context=20)
-   you have returned the agreement form to us.
