We’ll help you set up and use our digital services at your coaching session. This can increase your confidence in using our self service options when it suits you.

## Booking your appointment

If you have a Centrelink [Customer Reference Number (CRN)](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn?context=64107), you can book a phone or face to face digital coaching appointment.

You can book online, by calling your regular payment line, or by visiting a service centre. Read more about how to [book a Centrelink appointment](/book-appointment?context=64107).

During your appointment we’ll ask you some questions to help us understand the level of digital support you need.

If you don’t have a CRN, you can find out [how to get one](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn?context=64107#howtogetacrn). We can still support you to use any of our digital services even if you don’t have a CRN. You can [call us](/phone-us?context=64107) or [visit us](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

## Get ready for your appointment

Before your appointment you can look at our Centrelink [online guides](/help-for-mygov-online-accounts-and-mobile-apps?context=64107), which show you how to set up or use:

-   your online accounts
-   our mobile apps.

## What you need for your digital coaching appointment

It’s important to prepare for your appointment ahead of time and bring what you'll need.

If you book face to face digital coaching

When you come to your appointment, it will be helpful to bring your mobile, tablet or laptop if you have one, along with your charger.

For health and safety reasons we can’t use your device, but with your permission we can link it to a monitor. This allows us to coach you on your device easily and safely.

You should bring your myGov account details if you have an account. If you don’t have a myGov account, bring along your email address and we can help you set one up. If you don’t have an email address, we can still help you.

You will also need to have passwords or PINs for any devices or accounts you have, including:

-   your mobile, tablet or laptop, if you bring it to your session
-   the Apple ID or Android Google Play Store ID you use to download apps to your device.

To help during the session, you should also bring some identification documents. This may include:

-   driver licence or state or territory proof of age card
-   passport
-   Medicare card
-   Tax File Number and Notice of Assessment
-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs card.

If you book a phone digital coaching appointment

Have your charged mobile, tablet or laptop, ready to use.

You should have your myGov account details ready. If you don’t have a myGov account, you need to [create a myGov account](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink) and link it to Centrelink.

You will also need to have passwords or PINs for any devices or accounts you have, including:

-   your mobile, tablet or laptop
-   the Apple ID or Android Google Play Store ID you use to download apps to your device.

## When you need to change or cancel an appointment

You can [manage some of your appointments online](/how-to-manage-your-appointments-online?context=64107) by using your Centrelink online account through myGov or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app, if you have it set up. Or you can [phone us](/phone-us?context=64107) using your regular payment line.
