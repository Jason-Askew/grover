For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

Call the [Centrelink Indigenous Call Centre](/centrelink-indigenous-call-centre?context=64107) to speak to us about Centrelink payments and services for free.

## Office and call centre closures

Our [service centres, agents, access points](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) and most call centres will close for the Easter public holiday on:

-   Good Friday 3 April 2026
-   Easter Monday 6 April 2026.

This means your reporting and payment dates may change and you’ll need to report early.

You can use the tables on this page to check the changes to reporting and payment dates.

You can also check your Centrelink online account for your new reporting date over the Easter public holidays.

## If you have to report

If the dates you need to report to us have changed due to public holidays, you must report on your new reporting date so we can pay you.

When you report early, you’ll need to include what you expect to be paid for that reporting period. You must also do this for any other changes that may affect your payment. If you make a mistake, you can correct your report within 14 days, or when you next report.

You can still report your income to us, even when we’re closed. However, if you do this on a public holiday we’ll pay you after the public holiday.

You can also choose to report after your reporting period if either:

-   you’re unsure of your employment income
-   your circumstances change during your reporting period.

You can report once you know your employment income or the changes to your circumstances. We’ll pay you after you report to us.

## If you don’t have to report

If you don’t have to report to get your payment, we may pay you early. An early payment is your normal payment, just paid early.

We won’t delay payments because of a public holiday, but we may pay you earlier than normal.

When we make an early payment, we pay before your normal payment day and as close to it as possible. You’ll need to budget so this payment lasts until your next payment day.
