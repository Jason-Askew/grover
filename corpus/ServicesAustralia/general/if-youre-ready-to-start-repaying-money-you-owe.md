## Repaying money you owe

You need to do this if you owe us money, and any of the following apply:

-   you don’t currently get a payment from us
-   you currently get a payment from us and want to make extra repayments
-   you want to repay the money you owe in full.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can repay money online. To do this, sign into myGov and select **Money you owe**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also do this by using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you need help to use the Money you owe service, you can use our online guides. If you have a Centrelink online account, use the [Centrelink online account guide](/centrelink-online-account-help-manage-money-you-owe). If you have an Express Plus mobile app, use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app guide](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app-help-manage-money-you-owe).

If you need help repaying money or setting up a repayment arrangement, please call us on any of the following:

-   your [regular payment line](/phone-us)
-   the [Centrelink Indigenous debt recovery line](/phone-us#indigenousdebt), if you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian
-   the [Centrelink multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages), for help in your language.

If you repay your Centrelink debt using your credit card, you may be charged additional fees by your financial institution. This is because credit cards can charge a high interest rate and cash advance fees.

You’ll need to contact your financial institution for more information about these fees.

If you enter into a repayment arrangement with us to repay your debt over an agreed period of time, we won’t charge you interest. This only applies if you make your first repayment by the due date and keep to your arrangement.

If you’re experiencing financial hardship, we’d like to help. Please call our [debt recovery line](#toolbar-phone).

In some situations, we may use your tax refund to reduce the amount of money you owe. Find out more about [how we recover debts at tax time](/how-we-recover-debts-tax-time?context=60271).
