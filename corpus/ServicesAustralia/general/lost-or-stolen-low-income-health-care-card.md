# Lost or stolen card

We can replace a lost or stolen card.

You can request a replacement card either:

-   using your [online account](/centrelink-online-account) and selecting the **Request a document** option
-   calling the [Youth and Students line](#toolbar-phone)
-   visiting a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

We’ll send you a replacement card. This can take up to 14 days to arrive in the mail. You can get a temporary card at a service centre if you need one during this time.

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
