# Social security agreements

We have these agreements with many countries.

-   [Overseas pensions](#a2)

They may help you claim a pension if you're:

-   from another country but now live in Australia
-   from Australia but now live in another country.

Read about [international social security agreements](/international-social-security-agreements).

## Australian pensions

You may be able to claim a pension from us if you’ve:

-   lived in Australia but now live in an agreement country
-   worked in an agreement country but now live in Australia, even if you aren’t eligible under the normal rules.

## Overseas pensions

We can help you claim a pension from any agreement country while you’re living in Australia.

We can:

-   send claim forms to you
-   tell you how the claim process works in that country
-   tell you which documents you’ll need
-   help you give all the details you need to make your claim go through as quickly as possible.

We may also advise on how to claim a pension from a country that doesn’t have an agreement with Australia.
