## Apply online

There are 2 ways to apply online.

You can use the Medicare Entitlement Statement (MES) dashboard in the Individual Healthcare Identifiers service through myGov.

If your IHI service is linked to myGov, sign in now to access your MES dashboard.

[Sign in to myGov](https://ihis.servicesaustralia.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/ihi/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=/ihi/mes)

You’ll be prompted to create an IHI or link it to myGov if you don’t have these set up. You must be in Australia when you apply for an IHI so we can verify your identity.

Read about [how to link the IHI service](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/link-individual-healthcare-identifier-service) to your myGov account on the myGov website.

You can also use the MES dashboard to:

-   track the progress of your application
-   upload documents, if needed for your application
-   download and print your statements.

If you request letters to be sent to your myGov Inbox, we’ll also send you a message whenever there’s an update in your MES dashboard.

If you can’t use the MES dashboard, you can apply using the [Medicare Entitlement Statement online application](https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/document-upload-capability#/?document=e260b7fc-e884-466b-b134-535c42b0f04e).
