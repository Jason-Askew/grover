# Who needs to apply

You don’t need to apply for a Health Care Card. If you're eligible, we’ll post your card to you.

We usually issue your Health Care Card for 1 year from the date we grant you the qualifying payment.

[

Renewing a card

If you’re still eligible to get a health care card, we’ll issue you a new card before the current one ends. You don’t need to do anything.
