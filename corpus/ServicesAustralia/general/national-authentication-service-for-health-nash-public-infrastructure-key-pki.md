# NASH PKI

National Authentication Service for Health (NASH) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates allow organisations to connect to our health systems securely.

You need a National Authentication Service for Health (NASH) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Certificate to allow your organisation to securely transact with My Health Record and other digital health systems.

Before you apply for your NASH PKI certificate, make sure:

-   your organisation is registered in the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service
-   you’re linked as an organisation maintenance officer (OMO)
-   your individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account is [linked to your Healthcare Identifiers-Individual (HI-I) record in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)](/link-your-healthcare-identifiers-to-hpos?context=20).

You need to provide a mobile phone number. We’ll send you an SMS when your certificate is ready and we’ll add this number to the system.
