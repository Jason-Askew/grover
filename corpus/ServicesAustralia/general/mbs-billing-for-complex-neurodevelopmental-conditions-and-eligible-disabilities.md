## Billing requirements

To be eligible to claim or bill these Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items you must provide:

-   all services to the eligible patient personally
-   the service to a single patient on a single occasion.

The patient must be present for all services provided.

Allied health professionals must provide allied health assessment and treatment items as non-admitted or outpatient services.

Allied health services don’t attract Medicare benefits until we’ve paid the prerequisite medical practitioner item.

## Billing referral pathways

The item numbers for assessment, diagnosis and treatment cover:

-   assessment and diagnosis
-   making a treatment and management plan
-   treatment services.

At the end of each stage, the responsible health professional should provide a written document. This could be a referral, a treatment plan or a report.

These services can be performed and billed through telehealth. Read about [Telehealth MBS items](/telehealth-billing-codes-for-mbs-items?context=20).
