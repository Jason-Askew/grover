# How to manage your assessment

Your options and obligations for a child support assessment.

You can [manage your child support payments and details online](/child-support-online-accounts).

[

Compare your child support collection options

Compare the difference between Child Support Collect and Private Collect and choose how you want to receive child support.

[

Self employed parents

If you're self employed and pay child support through us, you can use most payment methods.


](/self-employed-parents-with-child-support-assessment?context=21911)

[

Change of circumstances

You need to let us know if your circumstances change. Some changes can affect your child support payments. Find out what to tell us and how to let us know.


](/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21911)

[

Changing your child’s care arrangements

If the amount of time you care or share the care for a child changes, this may affect your payments and services.


](/changing-your-childs-care-arrangements?context=21911)

[

Care calendar

Use this calendar to let us know how often you care for a child. We use this to work out your percentage of care to calculate FTB payments and child support.


](/care-calendar-for-when-care-arrangements-for-child-changes?context=21911)

[

Changing your assessment in special circumstances

We can change your child support in special circumstances if the change is fair to both parents and the child.


](/changing-your-child-support-assessment-special-circumstances?context=21911)

[

Disputed care and interim periods

Disputed care is when parents stop following a written care arrangement without both parents agreeing to do so. An interim period may apply when this happens.


](/disputed-care-and-interim-periods?context=21911)

[

Child support when your child turns 18

Normally child support stops when your child turns 18. If your child's in secondary study, you can apply to extend it to the end of the school year.


](/child-support-when-your-child-turns-18?context=21911)

[

Child support and military deployment

When you leave Australia on military deployment you need to tell us your new details. This is so we can make sure your child support is still accurate.


](/child-support-and-military-deployment?context=21911)

Child support if you go to prison

You must tell us if you go to prison. This is so we can make sure your child support is accurate.

While living outside Australia

In some cases we can help separated parents with child support arrangements for their children when one parent lives in another country.

Registering a maintenance liability made outside Australia

Registering an Australian maintenance order or court registered maintenance agreement
