# Meeting your mutual obligation requirements

If you’re a job seeker and get Carer Allowance, you can meet your mutual obligations requirements by doing approved activities.

Mutual obligation requirements are tasks and activities you agree to do to help you find a job. Your Job Plan includes these details.

These requirements will apply if you’re getting one of these payments:

-   JobSeeker Payment
-   Parenting Payment single after your youngest child turns 6
-   Youth Allowance for job seekers
-   Special Benefit.

If you get one of these payments and Carer Allowance, you can meet your mutual obligation requirements by doing approved activities. This includes one or more of these activities:

-   paid work
-   self-employment
-   approved study
-   voluntary work.

You’ll need to complete one of these activities or a combination of activities for at least 30 hours per fortnight.

If you’re doing voluntary work, you also need to do a minimum of 15 hours per fortnight of another approved activity. For example, study or paid work.

## The points target

If you’re with Workforce Australia, you’ll have a points target. You’ll need to earn a set number of points each month to meet your requirements. Your target will be reduced by 40 points if you meet all of the following:

-   you have mutual obligation requirements
-   you're connected to a Workforce Australia employment services provider
-   you get Carer Allowance.
