# Redundancy information for employers

We can help you give support and information to staff facing redundancy or retrenchment.

-   [Your obligations](#a1)
-   [Support for employers](#a2)
-   [Support for your staff](#a3)

## Your obligations

If you’re considering redundancy or retrenchment of 15 or more staff, you need to give us written notification.

You need to copy the details of the [Notice to Services Australia of proposed dismissals](/sites/default/files/notice-to-services-australia-of-proposed-dismissals.docx "Word document") document to your company’s letterhead in Microsoft Word format. It needs to include all of the following:

-   the name of your company
-   the registered address
-   the number of affected staff and employment types.

### Submit your notification

Please fill in the form in Microsoft Word format. You can submit it to our [National Business Gateway](/business-and-employer-contact-information#businessgateway) team.

## Support for employers

Our [National Business Gateway](/business-and-employer-contact-information) makes it easier for Australian businesses to do business with us. They also offer help when retrenching staff.

Our [Financial Information Service](/financial-information-service) can help your staff in these situations as well.

We can organise information sessions that can help your staff facing redundancy with investment and financial concerns.

You can ask for an information session when you either:

-   provide your written notification
-   call our [Older Australians line](#toolbar-phone).

If you call us, say Financial Information Service when prompted.

## Support for your staff

You can refer your staff who are facing redundancy to call our [Employment services line](#toolbar-phone). They can register for employment services. We can help them even if they aren’t eligible for payments. This includes access to all of the following:

-   [employment services](/looking-for-work-and-job-hunting)
-   [income support payments](/getting-payment-when-youre-recently-unemployed)
-   [social workers](/social-work-services).

You can find more information about [support for retrenched workers](https://whatsnext.dewr.gov.au/where-do-i-stand/support-retrenched-workers) on the Australian Government’s What’s Next website.
