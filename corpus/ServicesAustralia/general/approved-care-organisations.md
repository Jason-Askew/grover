# Approved care organisations

An approved care organisation may be eligible to get Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for young people in their care.

You can get $71.26 per fortnight of FTB for a child aged 0 to 19 in your care.

To get FTB for a young person in your care, they must be all of the following:

-   a client of your organisation
-   an Australian resident
-   not getting an [income support payment](/income-support-payment?context=60271) in their own right
-   not in the care of another individual or organisation.

They must also be one of the following:

-   younger than 16
-   aged 16 to 19 and meets [study requirements](/family-tax-benefit-part-eligibility?context=22151#study).

To apply for approved care organisation status, please complete the [Application for Approved Care Organisation status form (FA083)](/fa083?context=60075).

Once approved, we’ll send you an admission, transfer or discharge spreadsheet. You’ll need to complete this to have your FTB claim assessed.

We’ll send you letters about your FTB payments every fortnight. You should check these to make sure you’re getting the right amount of FTB. If any information is incorrect, you need to tell us so we can adjust your payment and help reduce overpayments.

## Obligations for approved care organisations

You must tell us about events that may affect your FTB as soon as possible. For example, if the young person in your care stops being a client due to transfer or discharge.

This information doesn’t apply if you’re an approved child care service for [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) purposes.

Contact numbers available on this page.
