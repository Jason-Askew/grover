# Family organisations

Sometimes families need services that are outside the scope of our service delivery. In these cases, we can link families to organisations in the community.

## National partnerships

We work with Australians at many stages of their lives. This includes during times of crisis or distress. When people need extra help, we can connect them with organisations that offer it.

These organisations offer counselling and support. This can be for immediate and longer term help if they’re at risk of, or are affected by issues such as:

-   [family and domestic violence](/help-from-other-places-for-family-and-domestic-violence)
-   severe distress
-   self-harm
-   homelessness
-   financial difficulty, and
-   child wellbeing

## Approved care organisations

An [approved care organisation](/approved-care-organisations) may be eligible to receive Family Tax Benefit for young people in their care.
