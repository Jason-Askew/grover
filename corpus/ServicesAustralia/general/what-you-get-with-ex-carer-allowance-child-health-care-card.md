# What you get

The Ex-Carer Allowance (Child) Health Care Card gives you discounts.

The card gives you:

-   cheaper medicines
-   extra discounts from state and local government authorities and some private organisations.

The discounts are different in each state and territory. Check with the provider.

When using services covered by Medicare, you’ll need to show your Medicare card and Health Care Card.
