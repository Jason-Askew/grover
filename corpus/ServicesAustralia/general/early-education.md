Early childhood education and care is any service that cares for children before primary school. This includes day care, child care and preschool.

## Get a payment

There are payments to help with costs of care.

[Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) (FTB) is a 2-part payment that can help with the cost of raising a child.

[Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) is income support you may be able to get if you’re the principal carer for a child who is either:

-   under 14 if you’re single
-   under 6 if you’re partnered.

If your youngest child is older, you may be able to claim [Jobseeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment).

### Using child care

If you’re using child care, [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) (CCS) can help with the cost of care.

You may also be able to get [Additional Child Care Subsidy](/additional-child-care-subsidy) if you’re in any of the following situations:

-   studying, training, looking for a job or working
-   experiencing temporary financial hardship
-   caring for your grandchild.

### Caring for a newborn or recently adopted child

If you’re caring for a newborn or recently adopted child, you may be able to get [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay).

### Caring for a grandchild or foster child

If you’re caring for a child whose parents can’t care for them or have died, you may be able to get [Double Orphan Pension](/double-orphan-pension).

Check what other payments we have for [non-parent carers](/support-for-foster-carers-and-other-non-parent-carers), including grandparent carers. There’s extra [support for grandparent carers](/support-for-grandparent-carers?context=60007).

## Find a child care service or preschool

Use [Starting Blocks](https://www.startingblocks.gov.au/) to find a child care service or preschool near you.

Every child can get a year of free or subsidised preschool or kindergarten. This must be the year before they start school. Read about [finding and paying for preschool](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/what-is-preschool) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing’s Pregnancy, Birth and Baby website.

### Before you enrol your child

You should claim CCS before your child starts care. Check [who can get Child Care Subsidy](/who-can-get-child-care-subsidy?context=60007).

Your child needs certain vaccinations before they start care. We cover the cost of all vaccines in the National Immunisation Program. To find out which ones your child needs, read about [immunisation for children](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/immunisation-for-infants-and-children) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.
