# How to manage your card

There are some things you need to do when you have a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.

You need to tell us if your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-when-you-hold-commonwealth-seniors-health-card?context=21966) or you [travel outside Australia](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-commonwealth-seniors-health-card?context=21966), so we can check you’re still eligible for the card.

If you’re still eligible, we’ll send you a [new card](/renewing-or-replacing-commonwealth-seniors-health-card?context=21966) before your current one expires. It’ll automatically update your [digital card](/digital-card?context=21966) if you have saved it in your myGov digital wallet.

If your card is lost or stolen, you should tell us straight away.

If you need to contact us:

-   call the [Centrelink older Australians line](#toolbar-phone)
-   visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

Contact numbers available on this page.
