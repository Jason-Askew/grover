# Disability Medical Assessment

You may need to attend a Disability Medical Assessment with Sonic HealthPlus when you claim Disability Support Pension (DSP). If you already get DSP, you may need to do this as part of a medical review.

For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If we assess your claim under [general medical rules](/general-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you may be asked to attend a Disability Medical Assessment with Sonic HealthPlus. Not everyone who claims DSP needs to attend. Sonic HealthPlus will contact you if you need to attend.

You may also need to attend if you’re already getting DSP. This is so we can check if you still meet the DSP medical rules.
