# Register on the Organisation Register

The Organisation Register allows health organisations to register and participate in government health care programs.

## Before registering

Before registering your organisation, you’ll need the following:

-   An active Australian Business Number (ABN).
-   Details of an Associate - a person listed against the ABN on the Australian Business Register (ABR). Sole traders, government entities, and trusts may have an authorised contact listed on the ABR.
-   Details of an authorised contact - a person with an active individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account and their registration authority (RA) number.
-   Provider location numbers of general practitioners (GPs) - who are providing services at your practice, so you can link them to the organisation’s site. Make sure their address is the same as the physical practice address.
-   Details of your accreditation or relevant exemption - as outlined on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing.
-   PRODA account - you need an individual PRODA account to register your organisation in PRODA before you can use the Organisation Register. Find out [how to register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).
