# How to manage your payment

Your options and obligations for Age Pension.

There are a few things you need to tell us so we can pay you the right amount of Age Pension. You must tell us within 14 days if:

-   your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-age-pension?context=22526), including changes to your income and assets
-   you or your partner get paid any [income from employment](/employment-income-reporting?context=22526), regardless of the amount.

If you have [scheduled reporting](/scheduled-reporting?context=22526), you must report any changes of circumstances during the period you’re reporting for when you report. This includes any employment income you or your partner have been paid. If you’re travelling outside Australia, you must contact us the day before you leave. This is so we pay you the right amount and you don’t get a debt. If you have scheduled reporting, you must report by 5 pm on the day we ask you to report, even if you don’t have any employment income. If you report late your payment may be delayed or cancelled.

You also need to tell us if your [financial investments](/financial-investments?context=22526) have changed.

If you have employment income, you don’t need to give us any payslips unless we ask you for them.

You may need to [tell us if you’re leaving Australia](/when-and-how-to-tell-us-about-overseas-travel-if-you-get-age-pension?context=22526).

We may be able to help you claim a [pension from another country](/social-security-agreements-for-international-services).

You can use [Centrepay](/centrepay) to pay many types of bills, such as bills for phone, electricity or rent.

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us about changes to your circumstances online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.
