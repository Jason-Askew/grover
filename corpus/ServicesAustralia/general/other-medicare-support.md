## Support for children

### Continence Aids Payment Scheme

If your child has permanent and severe incontinence, the Continence Aids Payment Scheme can help with your costs. It’s a yearly payment to help you buy continence aids for them.

To find out if you’re eligible and how to apply, learn more about the [Continence Aids Payment Scheme](/continence-aids-payment-scheme).

Children aged 5 to 14 with continence problems should see a registered health professional. It’s important to have your child checked at least every 2 years to:

-   see how their needs have changed
-   review their management plan
-   change the plan to meet their current needs.

Learn more about [help for children](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/bladder-and-bowel) on the Bladder and Bowel website.

## Support for long term conditions

### General Practitioner (GP) chronic condition management plan

A chronic condition is one that lasts or is likely to last for at least 6 months or is terminal.

Examples are:

-   asthma
-   heart disease
-   diabetes
-   arthritis
-   cancer.

These conditions need special care and attention. It’s important to get the help you need to treat and manage them.

If you have a chronic condition, talk to your GP. They can:

-   identify your health care needs and treatment options
-   create a chronic condition management plan with you.

Your plan may include visits to allied health providers, such as a physiotherapist. If you’re eligible, you may be able to get Medicare benefits for these services.

Learn more about [chronic condition management](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/chronic-conditions/managing-chronic-conditions) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

We have [reciprocal health care agreements](/reciprocal-health-care-agreements) with 11 countries.

If you travel to these countries, you may not have to pay for necessary health care. You need to be an Australian citizen or permanent resident.

In return, we may cover necessary care in Australia for visitors from those countries.

## Support after a disaster

### Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme

We may be able to help with out of pocket health care costs. This is if you have some from an act of terrorism or natural disaster the scheme covers. This is only if the care you got was due to one of these events:

-   **Tsunami**: Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December 2004
-   **London**: Bombing in London on 7 July 2005

## Support for all Australians

### Australian Immunisation Register

The [Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)](/australian-immunisation-register) is a national register that records vaccines given to people of all ages in Australia. If you [enrol in Medicare](/enrolling-medicare?context=60092), you’ll have a record on the AIR.

You can get a copy of your immunisation history statement by using either:

-   your [Medicare online account](/medicare-online-account)
-   the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

If you think a vaccine is missing from your immunisation history statement, ask your provider to update the AIR.

### Cleft and craniofacial conditions

[Cleft and craniofacial services](/cleft-and-craniofacial-conditions) help you with the cost of treating cleft and craniofacial conditions. You may get treatment under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) if it’s done by any of the following:

-   an orthodontist
-   an oral and maxillofacial surgeon
-   a dentist
-   a paediatric dentist
-   a prosthodontist.

Ask your health professional if they can treat you as a patient with a cleft or craniofacial condition.
