# Express Plus Child Support mobile app help - Set up app

Instructions on how to sign in and set up the Express Plus Child Support mobile app.

To [download the app](/download-express-plus-child-support-mobile-app?context=37601), make sure you connect to the internet. Before you start, make sure you’re using Wi-Fi or you have enough data on your device.

Remember to stay safe online and avoid sharing your passwords with other people. Before you download, check the Child Support app is the right one. Make sure Services Australia is the developer.

You’ll also need a myGov account with your Child Support online account linked to use the app. If you need a myGov account or help linking to your Child Support online account, read the [help pages](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help) on myGov.

The screenshots in this guide are from an Apple iPhone, but you can do the same on a tablet or Android device. Images may be different depending on the device you use.

## Sign in and set up for Apple and Android
