# Finalise your pre-birth claim

We need proof of your child’s birth to finalise any claims you started before your baby arrived.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can submit proof of birth online.

To submit proof of birth:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Add newborn child**.
3.  Answer all the questions and attach a scanned copy or photo of your child’s proof of birth.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app). To do this:

1.  Sign in to the app.
2.  Select **Add child**.
3.  Answer all the questions and attach a scanned copy or photo of your child’s proof of birth.

[Register the birth of your baby](/register-birth-your-baby?context=60001) as soon as possible. If you don’t, we may not be able to pay you.

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

This option will only appear if we’ve assessed your pre-birth claim.

If we haven’t assessed it yet, you should complete your Newborn Child Declaration form in full. Then upload this with your child’s proof of birth using the **Upload documents** function in your online account or app. Find out more about how to [submit your documents](/upload-your-centrelink-documents-online#submit) online.

When we process a claim for your child, we’ll create a Customer Reference Number (CRN) for them.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now and select **My family** to find your child’s CRN.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also find it using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app) in the **My family** tab.

The myGov website has a checklist to help you with the tasks you’ll need to complete [when your baby arrives](https://my.gov.au/en/services/raising-kids/having-a-baby/when-your-baby-is-born/when-your-baby-arrives-checklist).
