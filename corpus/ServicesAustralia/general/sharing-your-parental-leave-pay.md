You can give approval to share some or all the Parental Leave Pay days with the other parent. If you choose to share your days, you must meet the work test for the other parent to be eligible, even if you don’t claim any days for yourself. You can take up to 20 Parental Leave Pay days at the same time. There are [some exemptions to this limit](/exemptions-to-limits-parental-leave-pay-days?context=64479).

The other parent must also claim Parental Leave Pay to receive the days you share with them. When they claim, we’ll send a task to your Centrelink online account through myGov. You’ll need to complete the task to confirm if you [give approval to share Parental Leave Pay](/giving-approval-to-share-parental-leave-pay?context=64479). The other parent can only claim the number of days you’ve approved to share with them.

When you claim, make sure to only include the number of days you’re claiming for yourself. If you’re sharing days with the other parent, this should not exceed the maximum number of days.

For example, if you’re eligible for 120 days and you want to share 40 days with the other parent, you can’t claim more than 80 days for yourself.

The birth mother must first give approval to share any Parental Leave Pay days with you. You should discuss with them the number of days you’ll both take.
