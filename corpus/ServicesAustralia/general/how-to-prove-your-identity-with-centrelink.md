For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you want to claim a payment or concession, you need a Centrelink [Customer Reference Number (CRN)](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn). You can get a CRN by proving who you are with us, either:

-   online
-   over the phone
-   in person at a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

If you’re having difficulties getting documents to prove your identity, you can [contact us](/contact-us) for help.

## How to prove your identity for natural disaster payments

If you have been affected by a natural disaster, you may need to prove your identity when claiming a natural disaster payment. Find out [how to prove your identity for natural disaster support](/how-to-prove-your-identity-for-natural-disaster-support?context=60042).

## What happens if you have an authorised nominee

If you have a [nominee dealing with us on your behalf](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support#nominee), they can contact us to prove who you are. If we can verify your nominee over the phone, we’ll accept your identity details from them. We’ll let your nominee know if we need any further information.

## When you need to prove your partner’s identity

Your partner also needs to prove their identity with us, if you’re claiming one of the following:

-   [Low Income Health Care Card](/low-income-health-care-card)
-   [Farm Household Allowance](/farm-household-allowance).

They can do this [over the phone](/proving-your-identity-over-phone-with-centrelink).

If you’re claiming a Low Income Health Care Card, your partner isn’t required to prove their identity if they’re either:

-   already getting an [income support payment](/income-support-payment)
-   a current [concession or health care card](/concession-and-health-care-cards) holder.

If you and your partner are applying for the [Home Equity Access Scheme](/home-equity-access-scheme), you’ll need to visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/) to prove your identity.

## When the person you provide care for needs to prove their identity

The person you care for needs to prove their identity with us if you’re claiming either:

-   [Carer Payment](/carer-payment)
-   [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance).

The person you care for doesn’t need to prove their identity if any of the following apply:

-   they’re already getting an [income support payment](/income-support-payment)
-   they’re a current [concession or health care card](/concession-and-health-care-cards) holder
-   they’re recorded with us as a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) customer.

If someone you provide care for is turning 16, you can apply to continue getting a payment for them. You won’t need to prove their identity if they’re included in a child to adult transfer for Carer Payment or Carer Allowance.
