For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you leave Australia to live in another country, we’ll cancel your card when you depart.

If your travel is short term, your card will remain current for up to 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, we’ll cancel your card and you’ll need to reapply once you return to Australia.

## When and how to tell us about your travel

When you hold a Low Income Health Care Card, you need to tell us if you’re leaving Australia and either of the following apply, you:

-   are going to live in another country
-   will be away for more than 6 weeks, including when you’re going on a cruise into international waters.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to tell us about your travel plans. If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use your online account to get information on how your travel could affect your payments and concession cards.

If you can’t use an online account, tell us your travel plans by either:

-   calling the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone)
-   going to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

Australia’s immigration department will tell us when you leave. They will also tell us when you return.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.
