# Confirm enrolment

Before we can pay you Child Care Subsidy (CCS), you need to confirm your child’s child care enrolment.

When you claimed CCS, you may already have confirmed your enrolment details as part of this. If you completed your claim and there were no enrolment details, you’ll need to talk to your child care service. Ask them to submit your child’s enrolment details to us so you can [confirm them online](#howtoconfirm).

Before confirming your details, you must make sure they match your Complying Written Arrangement (CWA). Your CWA is the agreement between you and your child care service. It must be completed by your child care service, and includes details about your care sessions and fees. The same person claiming CCS needs to have the CWA with the child care service.

We can only pay CCS when your CCS claim has been approved and you’ve confirmed your child’s enrolment details.

## How to confirm the enrolment details

Once we get the new information from your child care service, you need to confirm the enrolment details. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can do this online.

Select the **task** in your Centrelink online account, and then select **confirm** to verify your child’s details are correct.

If a task doesn’t appear and you are getting CCS, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **Child Care** from the **My family** menu option.
3.  Select **Enrolments** and find the relevant enrolment details.
4.  Select **View details** and then **confirm**.
5.  Answer the questions about the enrolment to confirm these details are correct.

## What if your child’s enrolment details don’t match

If the information or fees in the enrolment details don’t match your CWA, speak to your child care service. They may be able to explain why the details don’t match, or update them.

If you still don’t agree with the enrolment, you should tell us what information is incorrect.

You can do this when you review your child’s enrolment online. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, follow these steps:

1.  Select the **task** on your homepage.
2.  Click on **view details** for the relevant enrolment.
3.  Click **confirm** to answer questions about which details are incorrect.

You’ll also need to talk to your child care service and ask them to update your enrolment. Your child care service will submit a new enrolment which you’ll need to confirm online.
