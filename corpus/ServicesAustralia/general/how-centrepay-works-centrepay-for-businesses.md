# How Centrepay works

Customers may ask to pay their bills or purchase goods and services from your business through Centrepay.

-   [Get customer consent](#a2)
-   [Centrepay for your business](#a3)

If you register your business to use Centrepay, you’ll pay a fee to use the service. We’ll send customers’ payments to your business by a secure electronic transfer.

Customers can ask to set up a Centrepay deduction in one of these ways:

-   using our online services
-   calling us on their [regular payment line](/phone-us)
-   visiting a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   contacting your business.

You’ll have access to either Business Hub or Centrelink Business Online Services (CBOS) to do these tasks:

-   get deduction and payment reconciliation reports
-   add, vary or cancel deductions with customer consent.

## Costs for using Centrepay

Centrepay is free to use for Centrelink customers.

From 1 July 2026, all businesses paying a transaction fee, will pay a standard fee of $0.99 including GST per transaction. We usually take this fee out of the Centrepay payment we make to your business. This fee covers our costs to administer Centrepay.

You must not pass this fee on to the customer.

## Get customer consent

You must get your customers’ consent for Centrepay. Your business and your staff must understand all the following Centrepay obligations:

-   getting consent from your customers before starting, or increasing deductions
-   knowing that customers can cancel a deduction at any time
-   being aware when cancelling a deduction, the customer is taking away their consent for the deduction to continue
-   understanding you must get consent from the customer when restarting a deduction
-   being aware in most circumstances you can’t continue to make deductions if someone is no longer your customer
-   being aware that we’ll let customers know about any deductions you set up on their behalf.

## Centrepay for your business

Using Centrepay for your business has obligations and eligibility requirements. It’s important understand all of the following:

-   if your business is eligible to use Centrepay
-   included and excluded goods and services
