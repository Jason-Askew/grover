# Care setting days and bulk events

Register care setting days and bulk events using the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

-   [Register care setting days](#a1)
-   [Register bulk events](#a2)

You need to tell us about any changes of circumstances for the people in your care by registering an event. We’ll use this information to decide what payments we make to you on behalf of your care recipient.

You’ll need an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to access the [Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP)](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)
