# What happens at the assessment

A Government-contracted Doctor will confirm your identity and speak to you about your medical conditions and the impact it has on you.

A Government-contracted Doctor will review the [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you provide with your claim. They may contact your treating doctors and other health professionals to clarify information about your medical evidence.

They review your [impairment rating](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and assess how your condition affects you.

After your assessment, the Government-contracted Doctor will write a report about the impact of your condition. They’ll then send the report to us.

Their report helps us decide if you meet the medical rules for Disability Support Pension (DSP).
