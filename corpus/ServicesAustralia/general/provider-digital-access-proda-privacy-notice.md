## What personal information we collect

The personal information that we collect from you or from a third party as part of the account creation and identity verification process will depend on the way you enrol with and authenticate to PRODA.

To create a PRODA account you need to provide us with your following personal information:

-   full name and date of birth
-   email address
-   gender
-   details from three [identity documents](/identity-documents-you-need-before-you-start-your-proda-registration?context=33786).

If you create a PRODA account using Digital ID, we’ll collect your following personal information with your consent:

-   full name and date of birth
-   email
-   information about you used to create your PRODA account and to authenticate you.

If we don’t collect your personal information, we won’t be able to either:

-   create a PRODA account for you as we can’t verify your identity and provide you with access to the PRODA system
-   register an organisation with PRODA which you’re authorised to act, by relying on information held by the Australian Business Register (ABR) and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) managed by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

## How we handle your personal information

We collect, use and disclose your personal information for the following reasons:

-   to create your Provider Digital Access system (PRODA) account
-   to verify your identity with the issuer of your identity documents or the entity that holds that information when you register to PRODA
-   to facilitate your access to PRODA using either your PRODA Digital Credential or your Digital ID, allowing you to access certain Australian Government online services
-   registering an organisation with PRODA where you are associated with and authorised to act for that organisation
-   to manage your PRODA account including your delegations and provide you with relevant support, so you can access Australian Government online services through PRODA
-   to detect, investigate and manage suspected or confirmed fraud incidents or cyber security incidents that may affect PRODA.

We’ll also collect your personal information from third party organisations in the following circumstances:

-   from the issuer or the record holder of the identity documents that you provide to us when you create your PRODA account so that we can verify your identity
-   from the Australian Taxation Office, which manages the Australian Business Register (ABR) and the Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) so you can register an organisation with PRODA
-   a PRODA organisation for the purpose of linking you to that organisation's PRODA record and so you can access Australian Government online government services on behalf of that PRODA organisation.

We may also use and disclose your personal information with your consent, or where it’s required or authorised by law, including for research purposes or conducting investigations.

We don’t routinely disclose your personal information collected in connection with the management of the PRODA system to overseas recipients.
