# Getting support

We can help you access payments and services if you’re living with disability.

Disability is any continuing condition that may impact your everyday activities. We can connect you and your family to support services, depending on your needs.

## Help with access to payments and services

If you need help, you can nominate someone to act for you. You can authorise someone to make enquiries, update information, make decisions or get payments for you. Help from a government funded advocate service or us is free. Read more about [getting help](/getting-help-with-disability-support-pension?context=60093) from a nominee, advocate or us including with a Disability Support Pension claim.

If you care for someone, we can help you access payments and services. This includes support when you need to [take time off work](/taking-time-work-if-youre-caring-for-child-or-adult) and [caring for yourself](/caring-for-myself-while-caring-for-someone).

We can help if you, or someone you care for, is experiencing hardship or crisis. This may include help in an emergency such as a [natural disaster](/natural-disaster-support).

## Help to keep people with disability safe

If you or someone you care for is experiencing violence, abuse or neglect, we have support and advice to help you. Read more about [safety if you’re living with disability](/disability-safety?context=60093).
