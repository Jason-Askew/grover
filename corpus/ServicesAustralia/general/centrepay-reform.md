Centrepay is a voluntary bill paying service which is free for Centrelink customers to use to arrange regular deductions from their Centrelink payment.

## Our approach

Our reforms seek to strengthen safeguards for customers and bring Centrepay in line with its original purpose as a regular bill-paying service.

As we reform Centrepay, we’re making several important changes to better protect our customers. We are:

-   removing high risk and under-used service reasons
-   using mandatory end dates or target amounts for certain Centrepay service reasons
-   expanding excluded expenses to include higher risk purchases
-   strengthening our compliance approach
-   amending the complaints handling process
-   introducing a standard Centrepay Deduction Authority form that all businesses must use.

These improvements will help customers to manage their own expenses, buy goods and services and foster financial independence.

## Who we’ve been working with

As we reformed Centrepay, we consulted with the following stakeholders:

-   consumer advocacy groups
-   Centrepay customers and communities
-   state and federal government agencies
-   Centrepay businesses
-   regulatory bodies.

Talking to a wide range of stakeholders has helped us understand the needs and benefits of customers including:

-   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
-   people living in remote communities
-   older Australians
-   people with disability
-   culturally and linguistically diverse people.

## Second round of consultation, March to April 2025

On 31 March 2025, we began a second round of public consultation called Shape the future of Centrepay.

This round of consultation invited input and feedback from businesses, customers and the broader community on the proposed Centrepay changes.

We asked you about how the proposed changes to Centrepay might affect you or your business. This feedback contributed to the final Centrepay reform.

## Centrepay obligations letter

In 2024 we sent letters to all businesses approved for Centrepay. In our letter, we outlined Centrepay compliance obligations and encouraged businesses to do an internal review to make sure they meet those obligations.

If you’re a business approved for Centrepay and didn’t get a letter from us, contact the [Centrepay for businesses team](/business-and-employer-contact-information?context=60075#centrepaybusinesses) for a copy. You can make sure the business details we hold for you are accurate. You can also tell us if you need help to understand your obligations and responsibilities under the framework.

You must give us accurate contact details while using Centrepay.

## Volunteer to withdraw

If you’re a business registered for Centrepay and can no longer comply with the Centrepay requirements, you can withdraw from the Centrepay program in accordance with the [Centrepay policy and terms](/centrepay-policy-terms-and-guides?context=23256).

To withdraw, your business must write to the [Centrepay for businesses team](/business-and-employer-contact-information#centrepaybusinesses) at least 20 business days before the withdrawal date.
