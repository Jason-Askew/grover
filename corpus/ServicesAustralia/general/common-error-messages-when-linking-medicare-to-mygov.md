# Common error messages when linking Medicare to myGov

Information about why you may not be able to link Medicare to your myGov account and how to correct the error.

To link Medicare to your myGov account, we need to be able to both of the following:

-   authenticate you
-   find the right Medicare record to link.

We do this so we can link your Medicare record to your myGov account and ensure that any activities in your myGov account are authorised.

Most people can give us enough information online for us to authenticate them and locate their Medicare record. But some people can’t do this online and need to call or visit us.

Find out what to do if you get an error message while linking Medicare.

## When you can’t link because we can’t find your Medicare record

We need to make sure that we link the right Medicare record to your myGov account.

We’ll ask you to verify details on your Medicare record. We do this by sending a one-time passcode to your mobile number or email address or you can use an identity document which we will verify. We’ll also ask you to answer questions about details given to Medicare in the past.

If you can’t answer enough questions, we can’t identify what Medicare record is yours. The system won’t allow you to link online.

## How you can assist with the linking process

Get the following ready before beginning the linking process:

-   Your Medicare card number and your Individual Reference Number.
-   Answers to some questions specific to you. This could include your Medicare claiming history and bank account details.
-   A mobile phone or email address that Medicare has on file, so you can receive a one-time passcode.
-   An identity document, such as your current Australian driver licence, Australian birth certificate or visa details.

Check that you’ve entered your details correctly. You may need to enter more details and try again.

Answer as many questions as you can. You don’t need to answer every question if you don’t know all the answers.

If you can’t answer enough questions, we can’t be sure that it’s your Medicare record. If this happens, you’ll need to call us and answer some different questions.

Once we’ve confirmed your record, we’ll give you a linking code. You need to use it to link Medicare to your myGov account.

You’ll be asked for your agency reference number when linking, this is your Medicare card number. You must also include your Individual Reference Number. This is the number that appears next to your name on your card. Enter all 11 digits without spaces.

## When you can’t link because your details don’t match

The details recorded with myGov need to match your name and date of birth held by Medicare.

If your details recorded with myGov don’t match the name or date of birth on your Medicare record, you’ll get the RFM128 error with the following message, ‘The details held by Medicare don’t match the details we have for you’.

### How you can correct the error

First, check if your myGov details match your Medicare details. To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) and select **My account**, then **Profile**.
2.  Under the Personal details heading, you’ll see **Your name and date of birth**. Check if they’re correct.

#### If your myGov details are correct but don’t match your Medicare details

You’ll need to update your name and date of birth details with Medicare. For your security, you need to call the [Medicare program line](#toolbar-phone) to do this.

When you call, have proof of your name or date of birth ready to give us. For example, a passport or change of name certificate.

Some changes may take overnight to update in the system.

#### If your myGov details are incorrect and don’t match your Medicare details

You’ll need to call the [Online Services Support Hotline](#toolbar-phone) for help with your Centrelink online account if you have it linked. You’ll need to ask them to update your details before you can link Medicare to myGov.

When you call, have proof of your name or date of birth ready. For example, a passport or change of name certificate.

When you update your details, the service will share them with myGov. Your myGov details will be updated.

Some changes may take overnight to update in the system.

#### If your myGov details are incorrect and you have connected Digital ID

You’ll need to [call myGov](https://my.gov.au/mygov/content/html/contact.html) and select option 1.

## When you can’t link because you’ve forgotten your myGov username or password

If you’ve forgotten your myGov username or password, you can either:

-   select **Forgot your username** on the myGov sign in page
-   select **Forgot your password** on the myGov sign in page
-   call the [Online Services Support Hotline](#toolbar-phone).
