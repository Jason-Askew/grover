# Reviews

We may review your situation to check you are still eligible for Mobility Allowance.

## on this page

-   [If you’re still eligible](#a1)
-   [If you’re no longer eligible](#a2)

If we select you for a review, we’ll send you a form in the mail. You’ll need to fill it in and return it to us by the due date that’s on the form. To return the form, send it to the address on the form.

If you can’t use the paper form, you can fill in the [Review of Mobility Allowance form](/ma003m) on your device. You need to submit the form to us by the due date that’s on the form we sent you.

Call us on the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone) before the due date on your form if either:

-   you can’t return the form to us by the due date
-   you’re not sure what information you need to give us.

Once we get your form, we’ll assess your situation.

## If you’re still eligible

If we assess that you’re still eligible for Mobility Allowance at the same rate, your payment won’t change. If you’re getting the standard rate and we assess that you’re eligible for the higher rate, you’ll automatically get the higher rate. Read about [who can get it](/who-can-get-mobility-allowance?context=22501).

If you’re still eligible, we won’t contact you and you don’t need to do anything.

## If you’re no longer eligible

If we assess that you’re no longer eligible for Mobility Allowance, we’ll send you a letter explaining why. We’ll send it to your preferred way of getting messages from us. This could be any of the following:

-   [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online)
-   [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account)
-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   a letter in the mail.

### Grace period

If you stop work, training or looking for work, you may still get Mobility Allowance for a short time. This is known as a grace period.

Contact numbers available on this page.
