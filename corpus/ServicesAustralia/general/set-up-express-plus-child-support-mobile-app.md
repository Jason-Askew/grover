# Set up the app

You’ll need to set up the app before you use it.

To set up the app, you need either:

-   an Apple device operating iOS 13 or above
-   an Android device operating 8.0 or above.

If you have an older device or operating system, you need to update the software available on your device.

You won’t be able to use this app if either of the following apply:

-   you’re unable to update your device or operating system
-   you created your myGov account using Digital ID.

If you’ve turned off your myGov password, you won’t be able to set up this app. You can turn your myGov password back on through your myGov **Account settings** if you want to set up access. You can turn your password back off after you’ve set up access. Read more about how to [manage sign in details](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/help-using-your-account/manage-sign-in-details) on the myGov website.

You can set up the app by following these steps.

1.  Select **Start now**.
2.  Accept the **Express Plus Terms and Conditions**.
3.  Enter your myGov sign in details.
4.  Enter the security code or answer your secret question.
5.  If you already have a myGov PIN, select **Continue**.
6.  If you don’t have a myGov PIN, create one.

After that, you can sign in to the app with your 4 digit myGov PIN.

Don’t set a PIN that’s easy for people to guess, like your date of birth. We recommend your PIN is different to other PINs you use.

If you can’t use the app, you can access your [Child Support online account](/child-support-online-accounts?context=21906) through myGov. You can do this using a web browser on your mobile device or a desktop computer.
