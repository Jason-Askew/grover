# What’s on it

Your payment summary shows most of your taxable and non-taxable payments the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) need to know about.

Your payment summary shows:

-   most of your Centrelink payments and allowances
-   payment dates
-   taxable and tax exempt amounts
-   tax withheld amounts that show as deductions.

Find out:

-   what taxable and non-taxable [payments show on your payment summary](/payments-show-your-payment-summary?context=22781)
-   what taxable [payments don’t show on your payment summary](/payments-dont-show-your-payment-summary?context=22781) that you need to report in your tax return.

Family Tax Benefit is a non-taxable payment. If you only got payments of Family Tax Benefit from us, you won’t get a payment summary.

Once your details pre-fill in your ATO tax return, you won’t need a payment summary. It’s best to lodge your tax return once all your information pre-fills. This helps avoid errors and having to resubmit your tax return.
