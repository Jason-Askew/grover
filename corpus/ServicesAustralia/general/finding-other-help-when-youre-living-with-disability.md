## National services

### National Disability Insurance Scheme

For many, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is the main source of support when living with disability. It provides funding directly to you if you have disability.

Developing a NDIS plan can help you with your day-to-day care. It may help you access support services for daily and occasional physical tasks.

Find out more on the [NDIS](https://www.ndis.gov.au/) website.

### Medicare

Medicare is Australia’s universal health care system. It helps with the costs of seeing a doctor, buying medicines and getting mental health care. Read about [what Medicare covers](/whats-covered-medicare) and [how to enrol](/how-to-enrol-medicare).

Use the [find a health service](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/australian-health-services) on the health direct website to find a doctor in your area. You can also check if local doctors can visit you at home or offer telehealth appointments.

### Disability Gateway

The Disability Gateway connects you with a range of services in your area. They provide support and information for all people with disability, their families and carers. They also provide information on health, housing, employment, transport and everyday living. Read more about the [Disability Gateway](https://www.disabilitygateway.gov.au/) on their website.

### National Relay Service

If you are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a communication difficulty you can register to use the National Relay Service (NRS).
