A Reconciliation Action Plan is an organisation’s commitment to reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

It builds on understanding, commitment and respect for culture.

It also aims to improve opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

## Our Reconciliation Action Plan April 2024-December 2026

Our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) April 2024-December 2026 shows what we have learned on our reconciliation journey. It also guides our next steps on this journey.

It commits us to progress reconciliation across 4 focus areas:

-   relationships
-   respect
-   opportunities
-   governance.

## Our marquee RAP project: Reflection

The marquee project of our 2018-22 RAP is the website [Reflection: experiences of First Nations people with social security and services from 1947 to 1997](https://reflection.servicesaustralia.gov.au/?utm_source=reconciliation&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=reflection_launch).

Reflection is a collection of artefacts showing how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples fought for access to social security and services.

Historical acceptance is a key theme of reconciliation. If you would like to join us in sharing these stories, we’ve created a Reflection eKit to help promote the project. The eKit includes the following materials:

-   a poster
-   a social media story
-   social media tiles
-   images.

The content in this online collection may be used by educators. Teaching resources for primary and secondary students are available.
