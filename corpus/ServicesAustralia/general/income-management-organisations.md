## Benefits

If you accept Income Management money from customers, your business can benefit the following ways:

-   regular payments from customers
-   improved cash flow
-   fewer overdue bills
-   less time and money spent on administering bad debts and service disconnections.

### Online search tool

If you have a contract with us your business will show in our [Find a business or organisation](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_una/business-organisation-finder/start) search tool. It helps customers check if they can buy essential goods and services from you.

If you don’t want your business to show on this search tool, you’ll need to tell us. To ask us to remove you from the search tool email [im.merchant.help@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:im.merchant.help@servicesaustralia.gov.au).

## How to get payments

We can make payments to your business in the following ways:

-   by direct deposit using your BPAY biller code and the customer’s reference number with BPAY
-   via direct deposit into your bank account using your business’s BSB, account number and a customer reference
-   under a contractual arrangement if your business is in an Income Management area. If you choose this option, we’ll make payments to a nominated bank account and send you a deduction report
-   credit card over the phone for urgent requests for expenses like food and travel.

Customers can:

-   use their [BasicsCard](/basicscard-for-businesses) to buy goods and services you provide
-   choose to pay your business one off or regular payments.

If a customer’s Centrelink payments stop, payments to your organisation will also stop.

Call the [Income Management and BasicsCard Merchant Helpdesk](/business-and-employer-contact-information#incomemanagement) to find out how you can participate.

### Refunds

You cannot give cash refunds at all. If your customer needs a refund, you must [contact us](/business-and-employer-contact-information#incomemanagement) and return the money to us. We will return it to the customer’s Income Management account.

### Credit

If someone is in credit when they stop being your customer, you must [contact us](/business-and-employer-contact-information#incomemanagement) and return the money to us. We will return it to the customer’s Income Management account.

### Fees

You cannot charge a customer a fee to use Income Management money for goods or services you provide. There are no fees to get Income Management money.

### Restricted items

Your business cannot sell restricted items to customers using their Income Management funds. You cannot let customers do any of the following with their Income Management funds:

-   buy tobacco or tobacco products
-   buy pornography

-   [Schedule 4](/sites/default/files/income-management-schedule-4-032020.docx "Word document")
