# How to get it

You don’t need to apply for Youth Disability Supplement.

We’ll check if you can get the supplement when you apply for either:

-   Disability Support Pension
-   Youth Allowance
-   ABSTUDY.

You need to tell us if you **don’t** want to get it. To do this either:

-   visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   call the [Disability, sickness and carers line](#toolbar-phone).

If you can get the Youth Disability Supplement, we’ll write to you and let you know:

-   when it will start
-   how much you’ll get.

If you disagree with a decision we make, you can appeal it. Read about:

-   [reviews and appeals](/explanations-and-formal-reviews)
-   [your rights to privacy](/your-right-to-privacy).

Contact numbers available on this page.
