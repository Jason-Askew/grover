# Types of scams

If a scammer gets your personal information, they can use it to access your online accounts where they can start stealing your information, identity, and money.

They could also use this information to call us or attend a service centre and pretend to be you so they can get a payment using your name.

## Text message and email scams

Scammers send text messages and emails that try to trick you into giving up your personal information, like your myGov sign in details.

If you get scam text messages and emails, a scammer might have your mobile number or email from stealing your information. This could have happened by opening a phishing scam or being impacted by a [third party data breach](/how-to-protect-against-scams-and-identity-theft?context=60271).

Scammers may:

-   tell you to click on a link to sign into myGov, to urgently give them ‘missing’ information. These links go to fake websites that look real but will steal your information
-   tell you to provide your identity information or myGov sign in details by replying to their message or email
-   tell you to click on a link to download an app or software to your device.

## Telephone scams

Phone scammers impersonate trusted organisations like myGov, Services Australia, Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support.

Scammers may tell you that you owe a debt, the government owes you money or that there’s a problem with your account. They may offer payment arrangements if you can’t pay the full amount or make threats to force you to pay them immediately. They do these things to make you panic or scared and to stop you from thinking clearly.

Scammers may also tell you that we owe you money. They do this so they can steal your financial details as they pretend to make a payment into the bank account or credit card you give them.

If you’re unsure who you’re speaking to, hang up and call us back on a [phone number](/phone-us?context=64107) from our website.

## Social media scams

Scammers create fake social media profiles impersonating us and other government agencies.

Scammers set up social media accounts to look like Services Australia, myGov, Medicare, Centrelink or even our employees.

Scammers use these accounts to respond to comments on posts and send direct messages offering to help you with enquiries about your payments and services. These accounts try to trick you so they can steal your information, like your myGov sign in details. Scammers will send messages with links that go to fake websites that look real but will steal your information.

You can find a list of our genuine [social media accounts](/connect-with-us-social-media#socialmediaaccounts).

Scammers may:

-   make fake accounts to look like Services Australia, myGov, Centrelink or Medicare profiles
-   make fake accounts pretending to be Services Australia employees and agents
-   respond to your comments and offer to help you, if you direct message or live chat with them
-   ask to chat with you on other platforms like WhatsApp
-   use dodgy usernames and poor spelling and grammar.
