# Start with Medicare

Starting with Medicare as a health professional.

When starting with Medicare, you’ll need to have professional recognition and meet eligibility rules.

You’ll also need to apply for a Medicare provider number and check the [eligibility and recognition rules](/eligibility-for-health-professionals?context=20) before you can bill patients and claim payments from Medicare.

Claim Medicare benefits

To claim Medicare benefits you can either:

-   bulk bill the patient
-   issue a private account to the claimant.

Claims need to clearly show:

-   the address and provider number of the place of practice
-   that the service qualifies for Medicare benefits
-   that the person who provided the service is a registered medical practitioner at the place of practice.

You should only claim if you’re either:

-   working in a private capacity
-   not getting other government funding for your services.

Apply for your initial Medicare provider number

If you’re a health professional, you’ll need to get approval for an initial Medicare provider number before you can claim Medicare benefits.

Apply for an additional Medicare provider number

If you already have a provider number, you may be able to apply for an additional provider number.

You’ll need an additional provider number if you work:

-   in a new practice location
-   for a new service at the same location.

Read more about how to [apply for an additional provider number](/apply-for-additional-provider-numbers?context=20).

Register for the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service

The Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service is a national system that uses a unique number to match health care providers to individuals.

If you’re an individual health care provider registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) you’ll automatically get a health care identifier.

If you’re practising in a health care profession that’s not regulated by Ahpra you’ll need to apply directly to the HI Service to get a health care identifier.
