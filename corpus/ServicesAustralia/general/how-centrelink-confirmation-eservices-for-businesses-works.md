# How it works

You can use Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS) to confirm who’s eligible for a concession, rebate or service you provide.

You can use it for Centrelink or Department of Veteran’s Affairs (DVA) customers.

To use CCeS you must have a contract with us. You’ll also need to get consent from your customers to check their details with us.

## Services available
