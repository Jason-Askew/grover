## Step 6: managing your members HPOS attributes

Once you’ve [added members to your Organisation in PRODA](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda?context=33786#a2), you can then delegate and manage their HPOS attributes.

You need to delegate HPOS attributes to your members so they can complete tasks on behalf of your organisation.

Select which **members** delegations you want to manage.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-06/add-hpos-to-org-step-5a.png)

Select **Attribute Delegations** then select **Delegate To This Member**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-06/add-hpos-to-org-step-5b.png)

Select **HPOS Access.**

If you want them to be able to re-delegate HPOS attributes to other members, select **Delegable**.

You can change their delegation end date in **To Date**. The maximum period is 12 months.

Select **Delegate**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-06/add-hpos-to-org-step-5c.png)

You’ve delegated HPOS access to your member. You’ll see their name and attribute in **attribute delegations**.

You can also delegate **HPOS Org Finance** to your member so they can access financial statements for the organisation.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-06/add-hpos-to-org-step-5d.png)

## Step 7: log out

You’ll now have the **Health Professionals Online Services (HPOS)** as a linked service provider under **My linked Services**.

You can add additional identifiers to access other services within HPOS by selecting **Link Identifiers**.

For your privacy and security, log out when you’ve finished using your PRODA account.

Select **Logout**.
