Published: 28 January 2026

If you need help with information and resources to deal with family and domestic violence or abuse, there are lots of options available.

Family and domestic violence is not always physical violence. It could be controlling behaviour, or emotional, sexual, financial, elder, or technology facilitated abuse.

If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or abuse and you don’t know what to do, we have information available to help.

We also have information for many more organisations who can help.

Find out more about [how we can help](/how-we-can-help-you-with-family-and-domestic-violence-concerns?context=60033) and [help from other places](/help-from-other-places-for-family-and-domestic-violence?context=60033).
