# Express Plus Centrelink mobile app help - Manage where your payments are sent

Instructions on how to change where we pay you using the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

## in this guide

-   [Step 1: get started](#step1)
-   [Step 2: change payment destination](#step2)
-   [Step 3: review and submit](#step3)
-   [Step 4: sign out](#step4)

If you have a Veteran Gold Card, you can’t update your bank details online. You can do this by calling us on the [Centrelink older Australians line](#toolbar-phone).

If you have a [payment nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support), you won’t be able to update where we send your payments. You’ll need to [contact us](/contact-us) to discuss your options.

Your payment destination is where you get your Centrelink payments. This can be a bank or another financial institution.

Before you start, make sure you have your new details, including all the following:

-   BSB number
-   account number
-   account name.

We recommend keeping your old account open until you get your first payment in your new account.

You must use an account that’s legally in your name or includes your name in a joint name. If you don’t have legal access to an account, [contact us](/contact-us).

## Step 2: change payment destination

The Financial details screen shows your current payment destination details.

To protect your personal information, we’ll only show the last 4 digits of your account number. If you don’t recognise these details, [contact us](/phone-us).

If you get multiple payments, you can have each payment go to a different destination. You can choose to update more than one payment destination. In this example, we’ll update one payment destination.

You can select either:

-   the **arrow** icon for the payment destination you want to update
-   **Home** if you don’t want to update your payment destination and go back to your home screen.

Select the **question mark** icon if you need help.

In this example, we’ll select **JobSeeker Payment** as the payment destination to update.
