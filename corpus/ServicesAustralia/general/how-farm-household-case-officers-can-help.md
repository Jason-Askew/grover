# How Farm Household Case Officers can help

A Farm Household Case Officer will contact you when you start to get Farm Household Allowance. They’ll guide and support you while you’re on this payment.

They’ll ask you to complete a [Farm Financial Assessment](/farm-financial-assessment?context=22161) to assess your farm’s financial position.

After completing the assessment, they’ll work with you on your Financial Improvement Agreement. The agreement helps you to improve your financial position. It sets out the activities you must do while you get the allowance. You can claim an [activity supplement](/activity-supplement-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161) which helps you pay for activities in your agreement.

You have 28 days to enter into the agreement or your payments may stop. Talk to your case officer as soon as possible if you need more time.

Your case officer will contact you regularly to review your agreement. Depending on your circumstances, the meetings with your Farm Household Case Officer can be through [video chat](/video-chat-appointments), in person at a service centre, or over the phone.

This video is about Pete and Sue, and how they use video chat to meet with their Farm Household Case Officer.

Each year you are on Farm Household Allowance, you need to provide an update on your farm’s financial position. Your Farm Household Case Officer (FHCO) will discuss the [Farm Financial Update](/farm-financial-update?context=22161) with you. Completing this update helps your case officer understand changes that happen to your farm business while you are on payment. They will use this information to provide tailored guidance and support.

Your FHCO can also put you in touch with a Rural Financial Counsellor. Find out about the [Rural Financial Counselling Service](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/agriculture-land/farm-food-drought/drought/assistance/rural-financial-counselling-service) on the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry website.

Your case officer can also refer you to other services that may help when you transition off the allowance.
