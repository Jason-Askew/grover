# Tell us about compensation

If you or your partner claim, get or stop getting compensation or similar payments, you need to tell us.

We need to know details of any compensation you or your partner have claimed if either of you have also claimed an income support payment from us.

You can give us this information in any of the following ways:

-   by completing the [Compensation and damages form (MOD C)](/mod-c)
-   by adding details to your online claim for an income support payment
-   by calling us on the [Centrelink compensation recovery line](/phone-us?context=64107#centrelinkcompensation).

## Request to complete a Compensation and damages form (MOD C)

Under an agreement with the Australian Taxation Office, we may get the payroll information your employer has reported via [Single Touch Payroll](/single-touch-payroll-data?context=22). If your employer has reported your compensation this way, we may send you a form to complete.

We’ll send a letter to your myGov Inbox or by post asking you to complete and return the [Compensation and damages form (MOD C)](/mod-c). Your payment may be stopped if it’s not returned to us by the requested date.

If you have any questions about this form, call our [Centrelink compensation recovery line](/phone-us?context=64107#centrelinkcompensation).
