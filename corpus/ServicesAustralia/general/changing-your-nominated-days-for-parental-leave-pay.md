# Changing your nominated days

If you’ve submitted your claim for Parental Leave Pay, you may change the days you nominated.

To get Parental Leave Pay you must be on leave or not working on that day, except for allowable reasons. When you claim you can nominate the days you want to get Parental Leave Pay. You should choose days when you’re not working.

If your employer is required to deliver your Parental Leave Pay, changing your days may impact this. Find out more about [getting your payment](/getting-your-parental-leave-pay?context=64479).

If you don’t know when you want to use your days, we’ll hold them in a balance. You can use them later, but you must use them within 2 years of your child’s birth or adoption. Any days that haven’t been used by this time will be forfeited.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can view, use and change your Parental Leave Pay days online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **My family**.
3.  Under **Paid Parental Leave**, select **Paid Parental Leave circumstances**.
