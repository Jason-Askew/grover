Read about [parents with 2 or more assessments](/parents-with-2-or-more-child-support-assessments?context=21911).

This page is for general information. To calculate an estimate of your child support payments you can use our [child support estimator](https://processing.csa.gov.au/estimator/About.aspx).

## Basic 8 step formula

Step

What we do

This step is about

1\. Work out each parent’s child support income

We calculate each parent’s child support income. This is a parent’s adjusted taxable income minus a self-support amount and any relevant dependant allowance. For more information about relevant dependant allowances, go to [child support assessments and second families](/child-support-assessments-for-parents-with-second-families?context=21911).

A parent may be able to estimate their income. Read more about [income used in calculating a child support assessment](/how-your-income-affects-your-child-support?context=21911).

Income

2\. Work out the parents’ combined income

We add both parents’ incomes to work out a combined child support income.

Income

3\. Work out each parent’s income percentage

We work out each parent’s income percentage by dividing each income by the combined total.

Income

4\. Work out each parent’s [percentage of care](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-child-support-payments?context=21911)

We calculate each parent’s percentage of care.

Care

5\. Work out each parent’s cost percentage

We work out each parent’s cost percentage using the [Care and Cost table](#careandcost).

Care

6\. Work out each parent’s child support percentage

We subtract the cost percentage from the income percentage for each parent. We call this the child support percentage. The result will determine if a parent pays or gets child support.

If it’s a negative percentage, we assess that parent as the parent to get child support. This is because their share of costs for the child is more than the amount of care they provide.

If it’s a positive percentage, we assess that parent as the parent to pay child support. This is because they’re not meeting their share of the costs for the child directly through care.

If you have different care arrangements for various children, you might have different child support percentages for each child.

We go on to steps 7 and 8 using only the positive child support percentage.

Child support percentage

7\. Work out the [costs of children](#costsofchildren)

We work out the costs for each child based on the parents’ combined total income. We do this by using the [Costs of Children](#costsofchildren) table.

Costs of children

8\. Work out the child support amount

We work out the total amount of child support payable. We do this by multiplying the positive child support percentage by the costs of the child. If we assess both parents are to pay each other, we offset these amounts before arriving at the final figure. This final figure is the amount the paying parent needs to pay the other parent.

Child support to pay

## Care and cost table

Your care percentage is the amount of time you spend with the child. This helps us to work out your cost percentage.

Your cost percentage is your share of the child’s costs that you meet directly through care.

## Costs of children

The Costs of Children tables recognise that raising children costs different amounts for different people. Because of this we work out your children’s costs based on all of the following. The:

-   [parents combined child support income](/how-your-income-affects-your-child-support?context=21911)
-   number of children
-   children’s ages.

### About the tables

Steps 1 and 2 of the [basic 8 step formula](#eightstep) explain what combined child support income is.

Under the formula, we deduct an amount for each parent to support themselves. We calculate the costs of raising children according to the remaining combined child support income of both parents. We divide the costs between the parents according to their share of the combined income.

The Costs of Children table represents net costs after [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit). All the figures in these tables are for child support periods starting in 2026.

Read about Costs of Children for past years in the [Child Support Guide](http://guides.dss.gov.au/child-support-guide/2/4/2) on the Department of Social Services website.
