When someone you know is experiencing family and domestic violence, you may want to help but don’t know what to do. The way you talk and listen to them makes all the difference.

It's common to feel unsure about the best things to say and do, but you should never feel too scared to say something.

There are some simple things you can do to support them:

-   Believe them.
-   Take their fears seriously.
-   Make sure they have privacy to be able to tell their story.
-   Respect their right to have control over what they say and the actions they take.

## What to look for

Below are some signs someone may be experiencing family and domestic violence:

-   They seem afraid of someone close to them, for example their partner, carer, adult child or parent.
-   They stop seeing friends or family.
-   They’re continually harassed with phone calls or texts.
-   They’ve become anxious, depressed, quieter or have lost confidence.
-   They have unexplained bruises, sprains or cuts on their body.
-   They have limited or no control over the way they dress, their activities, their use of technology or contact with friends and family.
