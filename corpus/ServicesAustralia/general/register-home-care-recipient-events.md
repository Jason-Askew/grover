# Home care events

Register care recipient events and report Commonwealth unspent amounts in the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

This information applies to care periods before 1 November 2025.

Support at Home has replaced the Home Care Packages Program.

You need to tell us about any changes of circumstances for the people in your care by registering an event. We’ll use this information to decide what payments we make to you on behalf of the care recipient.

You’ll need an individual PRODA account to [access the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP)](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account).

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)

If you need help to submit events you can call us on the [aged care providers enquiry line](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#agedcare).
