# How to get letters online

To get your Centrelink letters online, you need to link your Centrelink online account to your myGov account.

Once you do this, you’ll get most of your Centrelink letters in your myGov Inbox.

You’ll get an SMS or email when you have a new letter in your myGov Inbox.

If you don’t have a myGov account, [create one](https://my.gov.au/) on their website.

The myGov website has instructions on [how to create a myGov account](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account) and how to [link your online accounts to myGov](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account).

If you don’t have a Centrelink online account, [create one](/centrelink-online-account). You’ll need your [Customer Reference Number (CRN)](/centrelink-customer-reference-number-crn).
