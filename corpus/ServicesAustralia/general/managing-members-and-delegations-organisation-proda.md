You can add members to your organisation in PRODA to access services or manage functions on behalf of your organisation.

Only members with the [Employee-Management](/understanding-management-attributes-proda?context=33786) attribute can add new members.

If you want to add a member, they need their own [individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account?context=33786). They also need to give you their Registration Authority (RA) number and surname.

Once members are added, [you can delegate attributes](#step3) to them to manage functions on behalf of your organisation.

A delegated attribute isn’t transferable to another organisation in PRODA. It’s only valid for the organisation it was delegated to in PRODA.

If you need help with PRODA, you can call or email the [PRODA team](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).

## Step 1: log in

[Log in to PRODA](https://proda.humanservices.gov.au/prodalogin/pages/public/login.jsf) and select **Organisations**.
