## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 100 for patients with SMA.

Where the term **disease modifying therapy** appears it refers to nusinersen and risdiplam. Where the term **gene therapy** appears it refers to onasemnogene abeparvovec.

Nusinersen and risdiplam are PBS-subsidised for both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic SMA.

Onasemnogene abeparvovec is PBS-subsidised gene therapy for both symptomatic Type 1 SMA and pre-symptomatic SMA for patients no older than 9 months of age. Treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec is once only in a lifetime.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam.
