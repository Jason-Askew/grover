# Medical practitioner application for additional provider numbers

If you’re a medical practitioner, you can create an additional Medicare provider number if you’re eligible.

You can apply for an additional provider number through HPOS if you either:

-   have registered before 1 November 1996
-   are not subject to section 19AB of the _Health Insurance Act 1973_, and currently satisfy section 19AA through a postgraduate qualification.

You may also be eligible if you’ve trained overseas and satisfy 19AA with a postgraduate qualification.

In these cases, we’ll assess each application to determine if we can apply a 19AB exemption.

If you require a prescriber number separately, you must submit an [Application for a Medicare provider number and/or prescriber number for a medical practitioner form](/hw019?context=20).

Not all medical practitioners are subject to 19AB and not all 19AB exemptions are available through HPOS.

The following table shows which medical practitioners may be eligible to get a 19AB exemption through HPOS based on both:

-   work location
-   field of work.
