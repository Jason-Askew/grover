For help with Medicare, you can call the [Medicare program line](/phone-us#medicaregeneral). Let us know if you need an interpreter and we'll arrange one for free.

## Following the death

Find the person’s will and important documents. These documents will help you act on behalf of the person who died and tell you what their final wishes were. This can include if they want a funeral or memorial service or if they prefer to not have a service. It’s not a legal requirement in Australia to have a funeral. Check if they’re an organ and tissue donor. If you’re not sure what their wishes are, you can ask the hospital to check if they’re on the [Australian Organ Donor Register](/australian-organ-donor-register).

Check guardianship arrangements for dependent children and family members. There may be instructions in the person’s will about who they want to care for their children or dependent family members, or pets after they die. If [care arrangements for a dependent child or family member change](/centrelink-payments-and-care-arrangements), this may affect certain payments.

Notify family and friends of the death. You may want to ask them to contact other family members and friends. You need to tell us within 28 days when someone dies if they get a payment from us. We will then update our records to ensure they don’t get overpaid. There are other agencies, organisations and people you’ll also need to tell. Read about [who to tell when someone dies](/who-to-tell-when-someone-dies?context=60101).

You can check with us to see if you can get help:

-   [when an adult dies](/what-help-there-when-adult-dies?context=60101)
-   [when a child dies](/what-help-there-when-child-dies?context=60101).

If the person or partner was getting payments from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA), the defence force may help with some of the costs or arrange the funeral service if there is one. The following websites provide information to see if they can help:

-   [funeral benefit](https://www.dva.gov.au/families-and-dependants/financial-programs-and-services/bereavement-payments/bereavement-payments-funeral-benefits-and-other-assistance-under-the-vea#what-is-a-funeral-benefit) on the Department of Veteran Affairs website
-   [Returned and Services League](http://rslnational.org/) website.

## Registering the death

You must register the death with the births, deaths and marriages registry in your state or territory. They’ll then issue a death certificate. If you’re having a funeral, the funeral director will usually register the death for you. They’ll then issue a death certificate. The following links will take you away from our website.

## Organising the funeral

If you’re having a funeral, you can discuss the following with the funeral director:

-   plans for the funeral, burial or cremation
-   the cost
-   payment.

The Moneysmart website provides helpful information on [how to pay for a funeral](https://moneysmart.gov.au/manage-your-money-in-retirement/manage-health-costs-in-retirement/paying-for-your-funeral).

## Using the death certificate

It can take some time to get a death certificate.

Once you get the death certificate:

-   make multiple copies
-   have the copies certified by a Justice of the Peace
-   provide a certified copy to all the people, agencies and organisations who requested them.

A Justice of the Peace is an independent objective person approved to witness documents for official or legal purposes.

You can get your copies certified at most Police stations and libraries or with a local Justice of the Peace. You may need to show the original copy of the death certificate with the certified copy. Use our checklist to help you keep track of [who to tell](/who-to-tell-when-someone-dies?context=60101#tellother).

## Finalising an estate

It can take around 12 months for an estate to be finalised. It may take longer if it’s complex or contested.

You may need to [ask us](/who-to-tell-when-someone-dies?context=60101#askus) for information about the deceased person.

If you get a Centrelink payment and inherit money from an estate, it counts as an asset in the assets test and could affect your payment. You can find out more information on how the asset test may affect your Centrelink payment on our website.

The Australian Taxation Office has a [deceased estate checklist](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/deceased-estates/checklist-what-to-do-when-someone-dies) on their website that includes the steps you need to follow.
