Find out more about the [Support at Home program](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/support-at-home) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

## Home Care Packages

Care recipients need 2 assessments to work out their government funding for home care:

-   An Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) assessment to learn the care recipient’s needs and recommend and approve suitable services.
-   An [Aged care calculation of cost of care](/aged-care-calculation-your-cost-care) to work out how much the recipient will pay towards their aged care costs.

When a care recipient starts care, you need to register the aged care entry record on the [Aged Care Provider Portal](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20) (ACPP).

## Fees

In general, there are 2 types of fees paid by people who get a Home Care Package:

-   Basic daily fee is paid by everyone and is set by the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing
-   Income-tested care fee is paid by people who can afford to pay towards their aged care, based on their income.

You can ask your care recipient who’s getting government-subsidised home care to pay a basic daily fee. You can also charge an income-tested care fee if their income is above a certain level. There may also be fees for additional care and services.

We work out the income-tested care fee, based on the income details of the care recipient. We decide:

-   if they can pay an income-tested care fee
-   what amount the fee will be.

We’ll write to you and the care recipient if there are any changes.
