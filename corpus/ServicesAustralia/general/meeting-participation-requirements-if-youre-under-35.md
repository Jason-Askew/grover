Participation requirements include activities to help you prepare for and find work. These requirements are flexible. We’ll [assess your ability to work](/assessing-your-ability-to-work-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and your individual circumstances.

Find out if there is a [pause of participation requirements](/pause-requirements?context=22276).

-   you can work at least 8 hours per week
-   you don’t have a dependent child younger than 6.

You may need to attend appointments with your employment services provider, if you have one. Your provider will contact you about this.

You should stay connected with your provider to access support and assistance.
