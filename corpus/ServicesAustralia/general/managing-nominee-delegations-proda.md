# Managing nominee delegations

Learn how to nominate a member of your organisation to act on your behalf with a service provider.

## on this page

-   [Step 1: log in](#a1)
-   [Step 2: nominee delegation](#a2)
-   [Step 3: log out](#a3)

You can nominate a member of your organisation to interact with the [service provider](/what-services-you-can-access-with-proda?context=33786) on your behalf.

If you want to nominate a member, you need to [add them to your organisation in PRODA](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda?context=33786). They need their own [individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account?context=33786) and need to give you their Registration Authority (RA) number and surname.

Only members with the [Org-Owner](/understanding-management-attributes-proda?context=33786) attribute for a service provider can nominate a member.

A nominee delegation is only available:

-   for certain service providers
-   after you add the service provider to the organisation in PRODA.

Contact your [service provider](/how-to-register-organisation-proda?context=33786) to confirm if they accept nominee delegations.

If you need help with PRODA, you can call or email the [PRODA team](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).

## Step 1: log in

[Log in to PRODA](https://proda.humanservices.gov.au/prodalogin/pages/public/login.jsf?TAM_OP=login&USER) and select **Organisations**.

Select which nominee **delegation** attribute you want the member to have. Read about [understanding management attributes](/understanding-management-attributes-proda?context=33786).

You can change their delegation end date in **To Date**. The maximum period is 12 months.

Select **Delegate**.

Your member is now a nominee delegate. They can now act on your behalf with that service provider.

You’ll see their attribute in **Nominee Delegations To Other Members**. If you’re a nominated member you’ll see the attribute in **Nominee Delegations From Other Members**.
