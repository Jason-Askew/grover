# Reviews

If you’re getting Carer Payment, we may do reviews. This is to help us understand your caring circumstances.

We may ask you to:

-   [confirm or update your caring details](/confirm-or-update-your-caring-details-for-carer-payment?context=21816)
-   tell us about income and assets
-   complete a [proof of life certificate form if you’re older than 80 and live overseas](/proof-life-compliance-reviews-if-youre-older-80-and-live-overseas?context=21816).

We may ask for a medical review of the person getting care to check for any changes. Read more about [medical reviews](/medical-reviews-for-carer-payment?context=21816).

If the person you care for doesn’t get a pension or benefit from us or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs we may review your payment each November. Read more about [income and assets limits for the person you provide care for](/income-and-assets-test-for-carer-payment?context=21816#a3).
