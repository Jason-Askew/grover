# Providing aged care

Information for aged care providers about the aged care reforms, and the current types of care available.

## Aged Care reforms

The new Aged Care Act starts from 1 November 2025. It aims to protect the rights of older Australians who use aged care services, whether they need help at home or in a residential care facility.

### Support at home

From 1 November 2025, the Support at Home Program replaces the Home Care Packages Program and Short-Term Restorative Care Programme. The Support at Home Program provides upfront supports for care recipients to maintain independence, such as assistive technology and home modifications.

Learn more about [Support at Home](/providing-care-home?context=20#programfrom1november2025).

### Residential care

From 1 November 2025, you need to report information about care recipient accommodation agreements.

You’ll also need to retain a percentage of a care recipient’s lump sum accommodation payment for certain individuals and apply indexation to some Daily Accommodation Payments (DAP).
