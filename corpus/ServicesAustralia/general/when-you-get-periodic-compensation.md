# When you get periodic compensation

If you get periodic compensation, it may affect income support payments you get from us.

Periodic compensation payments are payments that are made on a regular basis because of a loss of earnings. They can be paid weekly or fortnightly to an injured person.

You may be eligible for an income support payment if you get periodic compensation payments.

The amount of income support payment we can pay you is based on your income and assets.
