# Caring for myself

If you care for someone, it’s important to make sure you’re also taking care of yourself. There’s support available to help you do this.

Caring for someone can be tough. It’s easy to become exhausted and overwhelmed. There’s support available to help you look after yourself.

## Breaks from caring

Sometimes you may need to take a break from caring so you can rest and recharge.

Respite care is when someone else takes care of the person you care for, so that you can have a break. Respite care can be given by family or friends or a respite service. You don’t have to be getting a payment from us to get respite care. Find out more about [respite care](https://www.carergateway.gov.au/help-and-support/caring-me/available-support-carers/what-respite) on the Carer Gateway website.

If you do get a payment for caring from us, you can use 63 days of respite each calendar year without your Carer Payment or Carer Allowance stopping. You can use these days for anything, including a holiday or simply taking a break from caring. If the person you are caring for goes to hospital, you can use hospitalisation days. These are different to respite days.

You need to tell us if you take a break or the person you care for is hospitalised. Find out more about taking a break from caring if you get [Carer Payment](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-payment?context=60097) or [Carer Allowance](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-allowance?context=60097).
