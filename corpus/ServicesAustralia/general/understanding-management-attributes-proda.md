# Understanding management attributes

You can delegate attributes to members of your organisation in PRODA.

After you register your organisation in PRODA, you can delegate attributes to members of your organisation.

An attribute provides a member permission to perform management functions on behalf of your organisation. This can be in PRODA or with a service provider.

You can only give a maximum delegation period of 12 months.

Attributes only apply to the organisation it was delegated to. You can’t use an attribute for other organisations.

Each attribute gives different permissions. Make sure you choose the right attribute for your member so they can do everything they need to.

## Types of attributes
