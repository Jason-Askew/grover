# Express Plus Centrelink mobile app help - Set up app

Instructions on how to sign in and set up the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

## Before you start

To [download the app](/download-express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app), you need to be connected to the internet. Make sure you’re using Wi-Fi or you have enough data on your device.

Remember to stay safe online. Before you download, check the Centrelink app is the right one. Make sure Services Australia is the developer.

To set up the app, you’ll need either:

-   an Apple device operating iOS 15 or above
-   an Android device operating 8.0 or above.

You’ll also need a Centrelink online account linked to your myGov account to use the app. If you don’t have a myGov account yet, you can [create one](https://my.gov.au/en/create-account/).

If you need help linking your Centrelink online account, read our [online guides](/mygov-online-help-guides).

The screenshots in this guide are from an Apple device. Some screens may look different if you’re using an Android device.

### Step 2: sign in to your myGov account

Sign in to your myGov account using one of the following:

-   your [myGov Digital ID](#mygovdigitalidentity)
-   your [myGov passkey](#mygovpasskey)
-   your [myGov sign in details](#mygovsignin).

#### Sign in using your myGov Digital ID

To sign in using your myGov Digital ID, your Digital ID must be connected to your myGov account.

If you can’t sign in to your myGov account using your Digital ID, you can find troubleshooting tips on [sign in with Digital ID](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/digital-id/sign-in-with-digital-identity).

Select **Sign in with Digital ID**.

Choose **Select myID**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-11/setupapp-step2g-181124.png)

The myID website will give you a 4 digit code.

Open the myID app to enter this code.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-11/setupapp-step2h-181124.png)

Enter the **code**, then select **Accept**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-11/setupapp-step2i-181124.png)

Close the myID app and come back to the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

Go to [Step 3](#step3).

#### Sign in using your myGov passkey

A passkey for myGov can be:

-   biometrics, such as fingerprint recognition or facial recognition
-   screen lock, such as a PIN or swipe pattern
-   a physical security key.

Select **Sign in with passkey**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-12/epc-set-up-app-step2b.png)

If you have more than one passkey for myGov, select **Other Sign in Options** to sign in with a different passkey.

In this example, we’ll sign in using our facial recognition passkey for myGov.

If you can’t sign in to your myGov account using your passkeys, you can find [sign in help](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/help-using-your-account/mygov-sign-in-help) on the myGov website.

Select **Continue**.

Go to [Step 3](#step3).

#### Sign in using your myGov sign in details (username, password and a myGov security code or secret question)

Enter your **myGov username** or **email** and **Password**, then select **Sign in**.

If you’ve forgotten your myGov details, select **Forgot username** or **Forgot password**.

This takes you to myGov, where you can recover your username or reset your password.

If you still can’t sign in, you can find [sign in help](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/help-using-your-account/mygov-sign-in-help) on the myGov website.

We’ll ask you to either answer a secret question or enter a code. This will depend on the option you use to sign in to your myGov account.

##### If you use myGov secret questions and answers

Answer your **myGov secret question**, then select **Next**.

##### If you use codes

We’ll send a code to you as an SMS. Enter this **code**, then select **Next**.

If you use the **myGov Code Generator app**, open the app, enter the code on your screen, then select **Next**.

Go to [Step 3](#step3).

### Step 3: create your PIN

Choose 6 numbers to create your PIN. **Enter your PIN**, then select **Next**.

For your PIN you can’t use:

-   6 of the same numbers, for example, 555555
-   repeat pairs of numbers, for example, 010101 or 121212
-   sequential numbers, for example, 123456 or 987654.

You shouldn’t set the same PIN you use to unlock your device.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-07/ep-clk-set-up-app-step3a.png)

Re-enter the numbers to **confirm your PIN**, then select **Next**.

![](/sites/default/files/2024-07/ep-clk-set-up-app-step3b.png)

If you have fingerprint or facial recognition set up on your mobile device, we’ll ask your permission to use it to sign in. You can also use your PIN every time you sign in to the app.

Select one of the following:

-   **Don’t Allow** if you want to sign in every time using your 6 digit PIN
-   **Allow** if you want to sign in every time with your fingerprint or facial recognition.
