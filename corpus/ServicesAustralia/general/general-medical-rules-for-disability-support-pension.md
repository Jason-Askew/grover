## What the general medical rules are

The general medical rules are:

-   your condition is likely to persist for more than 2 years
-   your condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276)
-   you have an [impairment rating](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) of 20 points or more
-   you meet [Program of Support](/program-support-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) rules, if these apply to you
-   your condition will stop you working at least 15 hours a week in the next 2 years.

If you meet all of these rules, you may be able to get DSP.

## What it means if you meet the general medical rules

You may be able to get DSP if you meet all the general medical rules.

Keep in mind, to get DSP you must also meet the [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

## What it means if you don’t meet the general medical rules

If you don’t meet either the general or [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276), you are not medically eligible. This means you can’t get DSP.

If you can’t get DSP you may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
