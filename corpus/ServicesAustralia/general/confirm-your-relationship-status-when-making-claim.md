# Confirm your relationship status

Learn how to confirm your relationship if you or your partner make an online claim.

If your partner is making a claim for a payment, we need to know their relationship status. This means they may need you to confirm your relationship status with us.

If they ask you to do this, there are 2 options available, depending on the situation. The online claim will tell your partner which option you can use.

You can use either:

-   the [Partner Confirmation Logon](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/authsvc/policy/tac&portal=DMODP) service online
-   the [Partner details form](/mod-p?context=60029) that both you and your partner need to complete and return.

If you can use the Partner Confirmation Logon service online, you’ll need a Reference Number and Access Code. Your partner can give you these.

If your partner uses one of our paper claim forms, we may contact you to confirm your relationship with them.
