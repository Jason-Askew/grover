## What you need to know

We’ll invite you to apply to [transfer to Age Pension](/transfer-to-age-pension?context=22276) 13 weeks before you’re [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension).

You’ll need to tell us if you:

-   want to transfer or not
-   have superannuation.

If you don’t do this, we may stop your Disability Support Pension once you turn Age Pension age.

We’ll send the invitation to your online account if you have one. If you don’t, we’ll post the invitation and form to you. We’ll fill in the online transfer or form with details we already know about you.

## What the benefits are

If you transfer to Age Pension:

-   there are no medical rules or medical reviews
-   you won’t be affected by an [income maintenance period](/income-maintenance-period?context=22276) if you get an employment termination payment
-   there is no limit on the number of hours you can work
-   we exempt more land from the assets test if you live on a single land title covering more than 2 hectares.

Keep in mind, some of these factors may change based on your individual circumstances.

If you intend to travel, compare the rules for [Disability Support Pension](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) with those for [Age Pension](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-age-pension).

## What happens if you stay on Disability Support Pension

If you stay on Disability Support Pension, you may:

-   get the [Pensioner Education Supplement](/pensioner-education-supplement) and [Education Entry Payment](/education-entry-payment) if you study
-   keep the higher rate of [Mobility Allowance](/mobility-allowance)
-   get a higher rate of [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) if you’re single and sharing privately rented accommodation
-   keep getting Incentive Allowance if you’re continuing in supported employment and not getting Rent Assistance.

## How to confirm your decision

You need to complete the online task or return the form we send you and confirm you want to either:

-   transfer to Age Pension
-   stay on Disability Support Pension.

You also must tell us about any superannuation you have.
