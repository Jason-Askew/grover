For help with Medicare, you can call the [Medicare program line](/phone-us#medicaregeneral). Let us know if you need an interpreter and we'll arrange one for free.

If your child has died, the payment you can get depends on all of the following:

-   your family’s circumstances
-   if you were getting a payment before their death
-   when you tell us about their death.

When you tell us about their death, we’ll work out how much and for how long we can pay you. Some payments are lump sums and others are paid over a number of weeks. For some payments you can choose either option.

Call the [Child bereavement and Double Orphan Pension helpdesk](#toolbar-phone) so we can help you.

There are also [support services](/support-services-when-child-dies?context=60101) available.

## Payments you may get

The payment you get depends on your situation and whether you and your family meet the criteria.

### Family Tax Benefit

[Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) (FTB) bereavement payment can be paid for up to 14 weeks after your child has died. You can get it as either:

-   [fortnightly payments](/how-to-claim-family-tax-benefit)
-   [a lump sum payment](/time-limits-for-submitting-lump-sum-claims-and-confirming-income-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151#lumpsum).

The amount and period we can pay you depends on both of the following:

-   your family’s income
-   the age of each child in your family.

You may get Newborn Supplement with your FTB bereavement payment. If you got Newborn Supplement you may get a top-up if both of the following happened:

-   your child died before their first birthday
-   you got the [lower amount of Newborn Supplement](/how-much-newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement-you-can-get?context=22186#newbornsupplement).

### Double Orphan Pension

If you are paid [Double Orphan Pension](/double-orphan-pension) for a child that dies, you can get up to 14 weeks of Double Orphan Pension. You can get this in addition to the [FTB](/family-tax-benefit) bereavement payment. You can choose to get both of these payments as either:

-   a lump sum
-   a fortnightly payment.

If you don’t get FTB you can get 4 weeks of Double Orphan Pension from the date the child died.

### Parenting Payment

If you’re single and your only qualifying child dies, you can continue to get [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) for up to 14 weeks after the child’s death.

If you need ongoing income support, you’ll need to claim another payment at the end of the 14 weeks. You can use the [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what payments you may be eligible for.

### JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance

If you’re a single principal carer and your only qualifying child has died, you’ll keep the higher rate of payment and concessions. You’ll keep these for 14 weeks after your child’s death. This applies if you meet these rules and you get either:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment)
-   [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance).

We’ll also reduce your [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements) for up to 14 weeks after your child’s death.

### Carer Allowance

If you’re getting [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance) for an FTB eligible child who dies, you may get a lump sum bereavement payment. We’ll pay up to 14 weeks of Carer Allowance from the date of their death as a lump sum.

### Carer Payment

If you’re getting [Carer Payment](/carer-payment) for a child who dies, you may continue to get this payment for up to 14 weeks after the child’s death. This is to give you time to apply for another [income support payment](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder), if required.

You will also get a lump sum bereavement payment. You’ll also be able to use your concession card for up to 14 weeks after their death.

## Payments if your baby was stillborn

If your baby was stillborn your family may get one of the following payments:

-   Parental Leave Pay for up to 24 weeks depending on when your baby was born
-   Stillborn Baby Payment as a lump sum.

Time limits apply to claim these payments. You must submit your claim within 52 weeks from their date of delivery.

Find out more to help you [decide between Parental Leave Pay and Stillborn Baby Payment](/deciding-between-parental-leave-pay-and-stillborn-baby-payment?context=64479).

## Payments if your baby died soon after birth

There are payments your family may be eligible for if your baby died shortly after birth, also known as neonatal death. Depending on your circumstances, you may get any of the following payments:

-   [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay) for up to 24 weeks depending on when your baby was born
-   [FTB](/family-tax-benefit) bereavement payment for up to 14 weeks
-   [Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement) for up to 13 weeks paid with FTB Part A
-   [Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) for up to 14 weeks.

You can get both Parental Leave Pay and FTB if you’re eligible. If you’re not eligible for Parental Leave Pay, you can get the Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement with FTB. Time limits apply to claim these payments. You must submit your claim within 52 weeks from their date of delivery.

You’ll get Parenting Payment if you’re eligible or already getting it. If you get Parenting Payment for another child, you’ll continue to get it after the 14 weeks as long as you’re still eligible.

## Medicare, concession and Health Care cards

If your child dies, we won’t issue you a new Medicare card, concession card or Health Care Card. The details will stay the same on your card until your current card expires.

If you’d like a new card without your child’s name on it, you need to ask us for one. To get a new:

-   Medicare card, call the [Medicare general enquiries](#toolbar-phone) line and ask for one
-   concession card or Health Care Card, request a replacement card through your Centrelink online account.
