## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with biological medicines under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 85 and section 100 for adult patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis.

Where the term **biological medicine** appears it refers to:

-   abatacept
-   adalimumab
-   baricitinib
-   certolizumab pegol
-   etanercept
-   golimumab
-   infliximab
-   tocilizumab
-   tofacitinib
-   upadacitinib.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing biological medicines.
