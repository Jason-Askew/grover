# Documents you need if you’re covered by a Ministerial Order

You need to provide documents that prove your identity and travel status.

You can enrol in Medicare if you hold a valid temporary visa under a Ministerial Order.

You’ll need to give us the following:

-   a passport, travel document or ImmiCard
-   proof of a valid visa from the Department of Home Affairs.

We need copies of these documents for each person you want to enrol. You don’t need to get your documents certified.

If you don’t have these documents, [tell us](/phone-us#medicaregeneral). We’ll talk to you about other options.
