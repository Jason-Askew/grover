## What to tell us

You must tell us if any of the following happens:

-   your address changes
-   [you sell your principal home](/real-estate-assets?context=22526#ifyousellyourprincipalhome)
-   your income or assets change
-   your partner’s income or assets change
-   you stop living with your partner
-   you marry or start living with your partner
-   your partner dies
-   you’re [leaving the country](/payments-while-outside-australia?context=22526) temporarily or to live somewhere else.

You have 14 days to tell us about the changes. If you don’t do this, we may pay you too much and you may have to [pay the money back](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink).

If you deliberately don’t tell us about changes, we could charge you with [fraud](/report-fraud).

Your Age Pension after your partner dies

When your partner dies, we need to reassess your income and assets. To stay eligible for Age Pension you need to meet the thresholds as a single person.
