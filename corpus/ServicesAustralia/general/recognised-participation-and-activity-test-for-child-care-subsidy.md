# Recognised participation and activity test

Your recognised participation may affect the hours of subsidised child care you can get.

## on this page

-   [Activity test for periods before 5 January 2026](#a1)
-   [Exemptions for the activity test for periods before 5 January 2026](#a2)

From 5 January 2026, the Child Care Subsidy (CCS) activity test was replaced. CCS eligible families can get at least 72 hours of subsidised child care each fortnight.

You can get 100 hours of subsidised child care each fortnight if either of the following apply:

-   you and your partner, if you have one, each do more than 48 hours of recognised participation every fortnight
-   you have a valid exemption.

If you have a partner, we’ll look at both of your recognised participation. We’ll use the lower of your or your partner’s recognised participation to work out your hours of subsidised child care. The hours of subsidised child care you can access per fortnight apply to each child.

If you do more than one [recognised participation type](/recognised-participation-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186), the total hours will count towards your participation level.

This is how we’ll work out your hours of subsidised child care.

## Activity test for periods before 5 January 2026

The CCS activity test was replaced on 5 January 2026.

For periods before 5 January 2026, we base your activity level on the hours of [recognised activities](/recognised-participation-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) you do and the type of activity you’re doing. We use your activity level to work out how many hours of subsidised child care you can get each fortnight.

If you have a partner, we’ll look at both of your activity levels. We’ll use the lower of your or your partner’s activity level to work out your hours of subsidised child care. The hours of subsidised child care you can access per fortnight apply to each child.

If you do more than one recognised activity, the hours you spend doing each activity will count towards your activity level.

There are 4 activity levels.
