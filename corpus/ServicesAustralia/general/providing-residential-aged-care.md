Residential aged care is for older Australians who can no longer live independently at home. The Australian Government funds residential aged care services to make it more affordable and accessible.

## Claiming Residential Care

You can use [Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP)](/aged-care-provider-portal?context=20) to do business with us.

You can access the ACPP with an individual or organisation Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. If you don’t have an account, register for PRODA online.

Residential Care reporting

You need to report a care recipient’s refundable accommodation balance as part of your monthly claim. This includes Refundable Accommodation Deposits (RADs) and Refundable Accommodation Contributions (RACs).

We use this information to keep care recipients' means assessments current, ensuring they pay the correct fees based on their financial situation.

When someone enters your care, you also need to tell us the agreed accommodation amount and the date it was agreed. You’ll need to do this as part of an entry event in the Aged Care Provider Portal (ACPP).

Using the ACPP

You can read steps on [how to use the ACPP](/using-aged-care-provider-portal?context=20) to do business with us:

-   claim residential care subsidies

-   view residential care payment statements
-   register and update bank details
-   manage residential care recipient events

## Retention of lump sum accommodation payments

From 1 November 2025, you’ll need to retain a percentage of a care recipient’s lump sum accommodation payment for certain individuals and apply indexation to some Daily Accommodation Payments (DAP).
