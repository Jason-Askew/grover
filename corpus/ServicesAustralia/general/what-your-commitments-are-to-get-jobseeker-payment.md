For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

## Mutual obligation requirements

[Mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=51411) are tasks and activities you agree to do while getting JobSeeker Payment from us.

## Completing your report

You need to report every 2 weeks, even if you don’t work, or haven’t been paid yet.

If you get an income support payment from us, you must report and tell us any employment income you and your partner get paid. This is so we pay you the right amount.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to report your income.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also report your income by:

-   using the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   calling 133 276 (13 EARN).

You can check your reporting dates through your Centrelink online account.

Find out more about [income reporting](/employment-income-reporting?context=51411) and get help using our [Centrelink online account guides](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app-help-report-employment-income).

If you want to report your partner’s income online, you’ll need [permission to enquire](/centrelink-or-aged-care-representative-to-act-for-you?context=51411#personpermittedtoenquire) or have a [nominee arrangement](/centrelink-or-aged-care-representative-to-act-for-you?context=51411#nominee).

## What a nil rate payment period is

If you report employment income and your total income is over the cut off point, your JobSeeker Payment reduces to $0. We call this a nil rate payment period. You can have up to 12 fortnights in a row of $0 payment before we’ll suspend or cancel your payment.

Your total income includes:

-   your income
-   your partner’s income
-   your combined income.

If we pay you at least $1 before the end of the 12 fortnights, we won’t suspend or cancel your payment.

The nil rate payment period will automatically apply if you start full time employment.

You must continue to report your income every 2 weeks to us so we can apply the nil rate payment period. If you have a partner, this applies to their income as well.

If your total income reported is below the cut off point within the nil rate payment period, we’ll automatically restart your payments. You won’t need to submit a new claim or serve any waiting periods.

If you’re getting a supplementary benefit or hold a concession card, these won’t be affected in a nil rate payment period.

To learn more about cut off points read about the [income test for JobSeeker Payment](/income-test-for-jobseeker-payment?context=51411).

## Change of circumstances

You need to let us know if there’s a [change in your circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-jobseeker-payment?context=51411). You should also regularly check the information in your Centrelink online account is correct. This is so we can make sure we pay you the right amount. If we pay you too much you’ll get a debt you need to pay back.

Changes can include any of the following:

-   a change in [your relationship status](/relationship-changes)
-   a change in your income
-   moving house or changing living arrangements
-   a change to your or your partner’s income or financial assets more than $2,000
-   you or your partner open or close a bank account
-   buying or selling a car, house or assets.
