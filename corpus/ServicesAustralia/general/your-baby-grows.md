## Immunise your child

Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting your child against harmful diseases. The more people who are immunised, the less chance some diseases have to spread.

Your child needs to meet [immunisation requirements](/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=60001) to get some payments. We may reduce or stop certain family assistance payments if your child doesn’t meet the requirements.

You can use the [Australian Immunisation Register](/australian-immunisation-register) to keep track of your child’s immunisations.

Find out about the [National Immunisation Program Schedule](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

## Learn about child health and safety

As your baby grows, it’s important that they have a safe environment so they can grow and thrive. We have information and support available to help you [keep your child safe](/childhood-safety).

## Discuss your return to work options with your employer

You may put a flexible working arrangement in place to help you transition back into the workplace.

Find out about your rights both:

-   during parental leave
-   when you’re returning to work.

Find out about your rights on the [Fair Work Ombudsman](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave) website.

## Consider your child care options

We offer help with the cost of child care through [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) (CCS).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to submit a claim.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

If you’re eligible for CCS, you may get extra help through [Additional Child Care Subsidy](/additional-child-care-subsidy).

There may be a waiting list for child care services. You can use [Starting Blocks](https://www.startingblocks.gov.au/) to find approved child care providers and availability near you.

## Tell us if you’re returning to work

Remember to tell us if you’re returning to work. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to tell us.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

In some cases, you may get a higher rate of Family Tax Benefit Part B. This includes if you’re returning to work for the first time since either:

-   the birth of your child
-   your child entered your care.

Find out about getting the maximum rate of Family Tax Benefit Part B for [parents returning to work](/family-tax-benefit-part-b-payment-rates#parents).

If you get Child Care Subsidy, you should [update your recognised participation](/update-your-recognised-participation-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) and estimate of income for the financial year.

If you’re a parent of a child born or adopted from 1 July 2023, the return to work rules will no longer apply for Parental Leave Pay. This means both:

-   you’ll no longer have to take your Parental Leave Pay before returning to work
-   you can now take the amount of leave that works for you.

You must not be working or planning to work on any day you have asked to get Parental Leave Pay.

## Discuss your future goals

If you’re a parent or carer of a child under 6 years, you may be able to get help to meet your personal, study or work goals.

Parent Pathways is a voluntary support service that is flexible and tailored to your individual circumstances.

You can work with a mentor who will assist you during your time with Parent Pathways. You’ll also get tailored advice in a safe environment, where your children are always welcome.

Learn more about [Parent Pathways](/parent-pathways).

## Check other resources

The myGov website has a checklist to help you with the tasks you’ll need to complete [as your baby grows](https://my.gov.au/en/services/raising-kids/having-a-baby/as-your-baby-grows/as-your-baby-grows-checklist).

## Help managing your money

We have some tips and information on how to [manage your money](/manage-your-money).

What you spend on your children’s education could be one of your family’s biggest expenses. Education costs can add up quickly. Planning and saving is the key to meeting your goals. Use the [simple money manager](/how-to-budget#simplemoney) to plan ahead.

Set a savings target that works for you. Then watch your savings add up. You can use the [savings goals calculator](https://moneysmart.gov.au/saving/savings-goals-calculator) on the Moneysmart website to make a start.

The [weekly payment option](/weekly-payment-option) can allow you to get your income support payment weekly. This can help you if you find it hard to budget a fortnightly payment. You can’t get Family Tax Benefit paid weekly.

If you get Family Tax Benefit or Carer Allowance, you can ask them to be offset. This means your payment can be paid on a different week to your [income support payment](/income-support-payment). To find out if you’re eligible, call [your regular payment line](/phone-us).

Saver Plus is a matched savings and financial education program offered locally by community organisations in every state and territory. Find out more about it on [the Brotherhood of St Laurence](https://www.bsl.org.au/services/saving-and-managing-money/saver-plus/) website.

Check if you qualify for a [no interest loan](https://goodshep.org.au/services/loans-and-insurance/) from Good Shepherd. These loans provide safe, fair and affordable credit for essential goods and services. You can pay this loan back through [Centrepay](/centrepay).

The [Financial Information Service](/what-financial-information-service) can help you make informed decisions about your finances.
