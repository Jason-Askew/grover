# Upload forms in HPOS

A guide to help you upload forms in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS) using the secure form upload function.

You can submit some forms online using the secure form upload function in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). You can securely send forms and supporting documents directly to us. This function confirms forms have been received and avoids postal delays and costs.

To access HPOS, you’ll need to use your Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. You can use PRODA to securely access many government services.

If you don’t have a PRODA account, you can register for [PRODA](/provider-digital-access-proda). Log in with your username and password, and 2-factor authentication step code.

There are 2 ways to access the secure form upload function in HPOS:

-   Using the form function.
-   Using the messages function.

Only one form can be uploaded with each submission. Up to 4 supporting documents can be attached with each submission. Each attachment must be less than 10MB. If it’s larger, you’ll need to compress it or send it by post. The blue bar above your attachments shows the MB used per upload.

Using the form function in HPOS

You can access the secure form upload function using the **Forms** tile if you’re submitting a form as a health professional or as a delegate on behalf of a health professional.

If you’re sending the form as a delegate, you must ensure that you are acting on behalf of the health professional in HPOS.

Follow these steps to upload and submit a form through the form upload function:

1.  Save a copy of the completed and signed form to your device.
2.  Log in to PRODA to use HPOS.
3.  Select **Forms**.
4.  Select **Secure form upload**.
5.  Select **Form category** from the dropdown list.
6.  Select **Form type** from the dropdown list. Then select either **PBS Authorities** for PBS patients or **RPBS Authorities** for veterans. Make sure the **Form category** and **Form type** you select match the form you upload.
7.  Upload the form and supporting documents. Select **Choose file** and then **Add file**.
8.  Write any additional comments in the **Text** section.
9.  Select **Send**.
10.  You can see a copy of your sent form as a message in **Messages**. Go to **Messages**, then select **My mailbox** or **My organisation(s) mailbox**.

-   a delegate on behalf of a health professional.

If you’re sending the form as a delegate, you must ensure that you’re acting on behalf of that health professional in HPOS. Learn more about [managing delegates who can act on your behalf in HPOS](/manage-delegations-hpos?context=20).

Reference Number

We give each form you send us a unique reference number.

To access the reference number, view the sent copy of your form and supporting documents in **Messages**. Go to **Messages**, then select **My mailbox** or **My organisation(s) mailbox**.

The reference number is useful in case you need to [contact us](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20) about the form you have submitted.

Additional supporting documents

If you have more than 4 supporting documents for a form, you’ll need to add more through a separate submission.

To add more supporting documents and link them to your original form submission:

1.  Select **Messages**.
2.  Select either **My mailbox** or **My organisation(s) mailbox**.
3.  Select the copy of the original form submission.
4.  Select **Reply**.
5.  Upload the additional supporting documents.
6.  Select **Send**.

This will make sure that the additional supporting documents are linked to the same reference number.

Delegates

Delegates in HPOS have access to use the secure form upload function. A delegate needs to use their own PRODA account to access HPOS. They can then act on the behalf of a provider in HPOS before accessing the secure form upload function.
