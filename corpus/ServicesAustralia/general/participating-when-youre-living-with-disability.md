The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides funding to people with disability to help with:

-   independence
-   community involvement
-   education
-   employment
-   health and wellbeing.

Read more about the [NDIS](http://www.ndis.gov.au/) on their website.

## Find work

If you have an illness, injury or disability, there’s help available if you’re looking for a job.

[Inclusive Employment Australia](/inclusive-employment-australia?context=60093) can help you prepare for, find and keep a job. We can refer you to a provider if you’re eligible. You can also talk to a provider about registering with them. You can [search for a provider](https://www.jobaccess.gov.au/i-am-a-person-with-disability/looking-applying-job/government-services-help-you/how-iea-can-help/find-iea-provider) on the JobAccess website. We may ask you to attend an [Employment Services Assessment](/employment-services-assessments?context=60093) appointment to assess your work capacity and confirm your eligibility.

You can register directly with an Inclusive Employment Australia provider if you’re at risk of losing your job due to disability, injury or health conditions.

Find out about [Inclusive Employment Australia](https://www.dss.gov.au/inclusive-employment-australia) on the Department of Social Services website.

JobAccess offers help for people with disability who are looking for work. It also supports people who have a job to get more training and better workplace skills. Read more on the [JobAccess](http://jobaccess.gov.au/) website.

## Community participation

Social and community engagement can have a positive impact on your wellbeing. You could find this at a community group, class or club.

Ask your local council, public library, public swimming pool or local sports club what’s on offer near you. Or enter your location in the [My Community Directory website](https://www.mycommunitydirectory.com.au/) to see what’s available in your area.

## Find an advocate

Access to effective disability advocacy can improve community participation. It can promote, protect and ensure full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. Independent advocacy can help people with disability who face complex challenges. An advocate can support you while you’re seeking help, claiming a payment from us, and can also attend appointments with you. Help from a government funded advocate service is free. Read about [Disability Representative Organisations](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-advocacy/disability-representative-organisations) on the Department of Social Services website.

Find advocacy services in your area and use the [Ask Izzy - Disability Advocacy Finder](https://askizzy.org.au/disability-advocacy-finder) from the Department of Social Services website.
