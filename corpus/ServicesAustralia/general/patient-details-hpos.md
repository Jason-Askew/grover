# Patient details in HPOS

A guide to find and verify your patient’s details using Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). Check eligibility, care plans and concessions.

You need a [Provider Digital Access (PRODA)](/what-services-you-can-access-with-proda) account to access HPOS. If you don’t already have an account, find out [who can use Find a Patient](/who-can-use-find-patient?context=20).

Log in to PRODA to access HPOS and use the steps to find your patient’s details or confirm their eligibility for concessions. You can use your patient’s Medicare card, Department of Veteran's Affairs (DVA) number or personal information.

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)

If you can’t use PRODA, contact the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness) for assistance.

Medicare details

You need a [PRODA account](/provider-digital-access-proda) to access and verify your patient details using [HPOS](/hpos?context=20). If you can’t use PRODA, please contact the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

If you have your patient’s Medicare card details, you can use it to confirm their Medicare details are correct. If you don’t have their card details, you can enter their full name and date of birth instead.

If there’s a unique match, you’ll get your patient’s Medicare card number, Individual Reference Number (IRN), and first name.

Steps to confirm patient details:

1.  Select **Find a Patient**.
2.  Select **Medicare patient** in the **Search type** and then what information you want to **Use**.
3.  Enter your **Patient details** and then select **Declaration** to declare the search is for claiming purposes only.
4.  Select **Find**.
5.  Once you have the correct details in the **Results**, select **Next** to view your patient’s profile page.

HPOS will tell you if the first 9 digits of the Medicare number and your patient’s first name match. This feature helps you find your patient even if there are any of the following:

-   issue number errors, for example if the 10th digit of the Medicare number is incorrect
-   IRN errors
-   minor spelling errors in your patient’s first name.

If there’s a mismatch between your patient’s first name and the IRN fields, HPOS shows the IRN linked to the name.

Use the date-of-birth field to help you identify the correct patient. This helps if 2 patients on the card have the same name, such as a father and son both named John.

Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) details

You need a [PRODA account](/provider-digital-access-proda) to access and verify your patient details using [HPOS](/hpos?context=20). If you can’t use PRODA, contact the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness). 

If you have your patient’s DVA card details, you can use it to confirm their Medicare details are correct.

If there isn’t a unique match but your patient believes they’re enrolled in DVA, they need to contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

Steps to confirm DVA patient's details:

1.  Select **Find a Patient**.
2.  Select **DVA patient** in the **Search type**, and then what information you want to **Use**.
3.  Select **Veteran file number**.
4.  Enter your patient’s **details** and then select **Declaration** to declare the search is for claiming purposes only.
5.  Select **Find**.
6.  Once you have the correct details in the **Results**, select **Next** to view your patient’s profile page.

Pharmacies can also use the patient’s full name and date of birth to find their DVA card details. This isn’t available for other health professionals.

Care plan history

You can access this service in HPOS with a [PRODA](/provider-digital-access-proda) account. If you don’t have one, [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

Steps to view your patient’s care plan history:

1.  Select the **Menu** icon in HPOS.
2.  Select **View patient care plan history**.
3.  Select **Find patient record** and enter your patient’s Medicare details.
4.  Select **Search**.
5.  Declare that you have your patient’s consent.
6.  Select **Continue**.

The search results will display care plan information for your patient including the following:

-   the date of service
-   item numbers
-   description of service, if relevant.

You can only view your patient’s care plan history if all of the following apply:

-   they’re over 18 years of age
-   they’re registered for a Medicare online account
-   they’ve given verbal consent.

A care plan refers to general practice services as part of Chronic Condition Management and the Better Access initiative. They include:

-   GP Chronic Condition Management Plans
-   Multidisciplinary Care Plans
-   Mental Health Treatment Plans.

If your patient hasn’t had a care plan created in the previous 12 months, we’ll let you know.

You can give practice managers or practice staff delegation access to patient care plans in HPOS by selecting **View Patient Care Plan History**. They can view this if the patient agrees to it verbally.

Practice managers or practice staff can also request delegation access in HPOS.

Practice managers or practice staff need delegation access to both **View patient care plan history** and **Find a patient**. This allows them to view patient care plan history in HPOS on your behalf.

You can see who you’ve allowed to act on your behalf by selecting **My delegates** in the HPOS menu.

Find out more about [managing delegations in HPOS](/manage-delegations-hpos?context=20).

Multiple patient verification requests

You need a [PRODA account](/provider-digital-access-proda) to access and verify your patient details using HPOS. If you can’t use PRODA, please contact the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

You can complete multiple patient verification requests with Find a Patient. This isn’t available for pharmacies.

Using multiple patient verification requests, you can search and confirm:

-   multiple patient details in a single request
-   up to a maximum of 50 patients in a request upload.

You’ll get the results in your HPOS inbox within 24 hours of your search. You can only submit one request per day.

Steps to submit a multiple patient verification request:

1.  Select **Menu**.
2.  Select **Multiple details request**.
3.  By accessing this service you’re confirming that you have your patient’s consent to search for and/or confirm their Medicare card details for claiming purposes only. You also agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information you obtain as outlined in the HPOS Terms of use.
4.  Download and complete the **Multiple details request** template file and save this file to your computer.
5.  Select **Browse** and find your saved file.
6.  Select the **Declaration** check box to declare the search is for claiming purposes only.
7.  Select **Upload** to upload the file.

Concession eligibility

You need a [PRODA account](/provider-digital-access-proda) to access and verify your patient details using. If you can’t use PRODA, please contact the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

You can use Find a Patient in HPOS to confirm your patient’s concessional entitlement.

Steps to confirm your patient’s concessional status:

1.  Search for your patient’s details in **Find a Patient**.
2.  Once you have the correct details in the **Results**, select **Next** to view your patient’s profile.
3.  Select **Concessional Entitlement** **Verification** tab on the left hand menu.
4.  Confirm the **date of service** and select **Declaration** to declare the search is for verification and claiming purposes only.
5.  Select **Verify**.

Most health professionals’ searches will return:

-   date of service
-   a concessional entitled result of **Yes**, **No** or **Cannot determine**
-   a verification receipt number.

Pharmacies can get a patient’s concessional entitlement information for Centrelink, DVA and PBS Safety Net. Pharmacy searches will also return:

-   a date of service
-   a concessional entitled result of **Yes**, **No** or **Cannot determine**
-   the relevant program entitlement number
-   a verification receipt number.

If a pharmacy gets a Cannot determine result, the patient needs to contact the relevant program to update their details and verify their entitlements.

We need the verification receipt number if you [contact us](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#hpos).

Concessional patients must hold or be listed on a Commonwealth concession card at the date of service. We base a patient’s concessional entitlement eligibility on the information we hold at the time the check is completed.

You can print the concessional entitlement verification results.
