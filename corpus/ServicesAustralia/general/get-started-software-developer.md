To develop software for us, you need to register for the Health Systems Developer Portal (the portal).

The portal is a secure platform that lets you access licensed development material and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). You can use the portal to help with product development and testing.

Only a legally authorised officer, like a director can register the organisation in the portal.

The following steps are the generic process for developing integrated software for:

-   Aged Care Online claiming
-   Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)
-   Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service
-   Electronic Claim Lodgement and Information Processing Service Environment (ECLIPSE)
-   Medicare Online
-   MyMedicare web services
-   Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) Authorities
-   Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) Online.

## Step 1: register for an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account

You need to [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account) before registering your organisation in the portal.

Read more about [PRODA](/provider-digital-access-proda).

## Step 2: register your organisation in the Health Systems Developer Portal

After you register for an individual PRODA account, you can register your organisation in the Health Systems Developer Portal.

On the [portal](https://healthsoftware.humanservices.gov.au/claiming/ext-vnd/) homepage, select **Register**. You’ll need to:

-   provide your details and your organisation’s details
-   enter your PRODA number
-   provide details about your head office, production support, and software development office
-   select your email notification preferences
-   enter your product platform type.

Only an authorised officer, like a director, can register the organisation in the portal.

After we review your request we’ll contact you. If you’re eligible to register as a software developer, we’ll send you portal sign in details.

After you register your organisation, you can invite your staff members.

## Step 3: sign in to the portal

Sign in to the [portal](https://healthsoftware.humanservices.gov.au/claiming/ext-vnd/) using your portal login details.

You need to read and accept the Interface Agreement, before you can access development resources. This agreement is a legal contract between your organisation and us.

We’ll email you after processing your agreement when you can access the technical resources.

## Step 4: invite your staff to the portal

You need to decide what level of access you want to give your staff. There’s 3 levels of access:

-   administrator
-   developer
-   view only.

## Step 5: begin developing products

You’re now ready to start developing for web services.

The Online Technical Support (OTS) team can help software developers diagnose and resolve technical issues during development and production. This includes technical issues in the vendor environment.

There’s no set development timeframe. Contact the [OTS team](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ots) for assistance.

## Step 6: preliminary testing

We recommend you test your software product in-house. This helps resolve issues before integration testing and ensure your software product works correctly.

## Step 7: integration testing

You book integration testing through the [portal](https://healthsoftware.humanservices.gov.au/claiming/ext-vnd/).

Integration testing verifies your software product works with our online claiming channels. Your software must pass all tests.

We’ll issue a Notice of integration (NOI) when we approve your software.

Once you get your NOI, you can use your approved software product to transmit claims.

## Step 8: your customers need to register with eBusiness

Your customers need to register with eBusiness using the relevant claiming channel and form:

-   [Online claiming provider agreement form](/hw027?context=20)
-   [Register or update for Aged Care web services form](/ac027?context=20)
-   [AIR - application to register as a vaccination provider form](/im004?context=20).

They can contact our [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness) for help.

You can contact the [OTS team](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20) for development advice on:

-   AIR
-   Aged Care Online claiming
-   PBS Authorities
-   PBS Online claiming
-   ECLIPSE
-   HI Service
-   Medicare Easyclaim
-   Medicare Online claiming
-   MyMedicare web services
-   My Health Record.
