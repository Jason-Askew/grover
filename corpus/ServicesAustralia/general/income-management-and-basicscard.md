# Income Management and BasicsCard

You can no longer start on Income Management with a BasicsCard.

We will now start you on [enhanced Income Management](/enhanced-income-management-and-smartcard) with an enhanced Income Management account and a SmartCard.

If you are already on Income Management, you can choose to move to enhanced Income Management with a SmartCard.

If you choose not to move, you will stay on Income Management and can keep using your BasicsCard if you have one.

But if your circumstances change, you might need to move to enhanced Income Management later.
