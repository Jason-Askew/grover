## Check if a text message or email is genuine

Scammers send text messages and emails that try to trick you into giving up your personal information, like your myGov sign in details.

There are things we will do when we send you a text message or email. We will:

-   tell you about new messages in your myGov Inbox
-   tell you about the progress of a claim, decisions about your payment, reminders about reporting and upcoming appointments
-   remind you about requests for information.

There are things we won’t do when we send you a text message or email. We won’t:

-   send you a link in a text message or email
-   ask you to open an attachment in a text message or email
-   ask you to reply by text message or email with your personal information or myGov sign in details
-   ask you to give us access to your phone, tablet or computer
-   threaten to deactivate your myGov account or records with us
-   threaten you with fines, warrants for arrest or jail.

## Check if a phone call is genuine

Phone scammers impersonate trusted organisations like myGov, Services Australia, Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support.

There are things we will do when we call you. We will:

-   call you from a private number
-   ask questions to confirm we’re speaking to the right person, this includes your verbal password if you have one. This is to protect your privacy and help prevent fraud
-   send you a letter if there are changes to your Centrelink payment or concession card
-   offer you options to [repay money you owe](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink?context=60271) that best suits your situation
-   only give you bank account details held by the Reserve Bank of Australia if you owe us money and choose to pay by direct debit.

There are things we won’t do when we call you. We won’t:

-   ask for your myGov sign in details, including your myGov password, PIN, or your sign in secret questions and answers during a call
-   play a pre-recorded voice message that asks you to press 1 to speak to our staff
-   call from a visible mobile phone number
-   ask you to pay for our help, payments or services
-   demand that you pay us money you owe straight away
-   threaten you with fines, warrants for arrest or jail.

If you receive a call that displays a caller ID saying it’s myGov, Services Australia, Centrelink, Medicare or Child Support calling, it’s not us.

## Check if a social media message is genuine

Scammers create fake social media profiles impersonating us and other government agencies.

There are things we will do when we use social media to communicate with you. We will:

-   always remind you not to share your personal information on our social media posts
-   only use our official social media accounts to respond to comments.

There are things we won’t do when we use social media to communication with you. We won’t:

-   send you a direct message or ask you to live chat with us
-   send you a direct message and ask you to click on a link or attachment
-   ask you to chat with us on WhatsApp, Telegram or WeChat
-   use social media platforms to ask for your personal information or your identity documents.
