# What it is

The Student Start-up Loan is a voluntary $1,349 loan for eligible students who get Youth Allowance, Austudy or ABSTUDY Living Allowance.

You can get the loan up to 2 times a year, once for each loan period.

The loan periods are:

-   1 January to 30 June
-   1 July to 31 December.

You don’t need to declare the loan to us as income for your regular student payment.

You must pay back the loan once you start earning a certain amount of income. This includes the amount you borrowed plus [indexation added to your loan](/paying-back-student-start-up-loan?context=23316) while you have it. Over time this can add up to a lot of money.

You should think about how this will impact you in the long term before you apply.

There may be other options that are better for you including [no interest loans](/understanding-loans-and-credit) for smaller items.
