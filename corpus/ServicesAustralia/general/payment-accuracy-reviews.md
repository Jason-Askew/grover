# Payment Accuracy Reviews

We review your details to make sure you’re getting the right payment and payment amount. If you have a partner, we’ll also review their details.

## What you need to know

We conduct Payment Accuracy Reviews to make sure your payment details are correct. These were previously known as Random Sample Reviews.

We interview a random sample of customers who receive one of the major payment types we deliver.

The reviews provide a point-in-time assessment to make sure people are not being overpaid or underpaid.

The review results help us to improve our policies and processes for all customers.

Our aim is for all customers to get the right payment at the right time, and the right amount.

Payment Accuracy Reviews are separate from any of our [Compliance Program](/compliance-program) reviews.

If you’d like to talk to us, [call our Centrelink Payment Accuracy Reviews phone line](#toolbar-phone).

## What we do

We may select you at random to review your payment details. We may review your and your partner’s details if you get one of the following payments:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Age Pension
-   Austudy
-   Carer Payment
-   Carer Allowance
-   Disability Support Pension
-   Family Tax Benefit
-   JobSeeker Payment
-   Parenting Payment
-   Special Benefit
-   Youth Allowance.

We’ll call you to let you know that we’re going to review your and your partner’s details. We’ll then send you a letter with an appointment time. The appointment will either be over the phone, in person, at a service centre or via video chat.

## What you need to do

You’ll need to attend your appointment. If your partner receives a payment from Centrelink, they will also need to attend the appointment.

If you have a Centrelink correspondence nominee, they may attend the appointment on your behalf.

If you can’t make it, call the contact person in your letter to make another appointment. Make sure you tell us before your appointment.

If you don’t attend your appointment we may stop your payment.

## What documents and forms you need at your appointment

Please check your letter to confirm what documents you’ll need to give us, and how to submit them.

We may also ask you to complete the RS017 - Random Sample Surveys Partner details form.
