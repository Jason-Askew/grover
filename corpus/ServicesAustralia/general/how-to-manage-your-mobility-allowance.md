Advance payment

You may get part of your income support payment or Family Tax Benefit (Part A) early. This is an advance payment. You pay it back later out of your payments from us.

Someone to act for you

You can ask someone to act for you with Medicare, Centrelink, aged care or Child Support. You can authorise them to speak to us, update your details and get payments for you.
