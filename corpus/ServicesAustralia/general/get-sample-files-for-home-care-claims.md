# Home care claim sample files

Sample files for software developers to transition your software to any of the home care changes.

Sample files for providers and software developers for home care.

On 1 July 2025, the Support at Home program will replace the Home Care Packages program.

We have sample files of payment statements and bulk file import files to help with home care claims. The IPA changes eKit has the following files for you or your software developer:

-   sample payment statement in pdf, CSV and XML, with explanations of the file elements
-   sample bulk invoice file import CSV
-   sample reported Commonwealth unspent file import CSV.
