# Eligibility for health professionals

We determine eligibility for Medicare benefits using the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) and related regulations.

Your eligibility for Medicare benefits depends on the field of work you’re in. Different fields have different eligibility requirements.

We’ll assess your application. If you meet all the eligibility requirements, we’ll update your Medicare provider record to show your new status.

We’ll send you a letter to let you know when your application has been finalised. The letter will tell you the date you’ll be eligible to start claiming the MBS items.

Medicare provider declaration

If you’re applying for a Medicare provider number online you must understand your legislative requirements:

-   You must apply for a unique provider number for each place of practice and profession you practise in.
-   You can apply for an additional provider number for a different location or at the same location.
-   You can’t claim a Medicare benefit until we’ve issued your provider number for that location.
-   You can’t use anyone else’s Medicare provider number.
-   You’re not eligible to claim Medicare benefits if we’ve suspended your membership or registration or if it has expired.
-   You’re not eligible if your membership level has changed.
-   If you don’t have access to Medicare, you must let patients know before you treat them that they won’t get Medicare benefits for your services.

General eligibility requirements

To provide a service that gets a Medicare benefit, you as a health professional must:

-   have a Medicare provider number for each practice location
-   meet eligibility requirements set out in the [_Health Insurance Act 1973_](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00255) or the relevant legislation relating to your specific health profession
-   have been advised in writing that you’re eligible to access Medicare benefits for your services.

If you don’t meet these requirements, you can still practise medicine. You still have to satisfy the requirements set out by your registration body. You can’t claim a Medicare benefit for your services.

You must let patients know they won’t get a Medicare benefit before you provide a service to them. It’s an offence to provide a service without doing this.

Intern, registrar and trainee eligibility requirements

You can’t access full Medicare benefits until you meet the general practitioner (GP) and specialist eligibility requirements. Until then, you’ll have limited access to Medicare benefits. As an intern, registrar or trainee, you can still get a Medicare provider number.
