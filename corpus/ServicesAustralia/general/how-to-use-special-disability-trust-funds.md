# How to use it

The funds of a Special Disability Trust are intended to meet the reasonable care and accommodation needs of the principal beneficiary.

Trustees are able to do all of the following:

-   pay for the beneficiary’s dental and medical expenses, including membership costs for private health funds
-   pay the maintenance expenses of the trust-property assets
-   spend up to $14,750 for the 2025-26 financial year on discretionary items not related to the care and accommodation needs of the beneficiary. This expenditure should remain compliant with the legislative requirements of a Special Disability Trust.

To find out more about Special Disability Trusts either:
