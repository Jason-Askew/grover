## Child support information for legal professionals

Legal professionals play an important role in the administration of the Child support scheme and providing information to parents about child support, including the amount, types and collection of child support.

Read [child support information for legal professionals](/child-support-information-for-legal-professionals).

You can estimate child support using our [Child Support Estimator](https://processing.csa.gov.au/estimator/About.aspx).

## Compensation recovery

Legal professionals play an important role with a compensation payer, usually an insurer, to a customer claiming compensation. The customer’s future payments from us may be affected by a compensation payment or past payments may need to be repaid.
