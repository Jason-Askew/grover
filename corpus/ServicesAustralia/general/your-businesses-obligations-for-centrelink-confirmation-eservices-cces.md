-   [Changes to your business](#a3)
-   [Privacy and security](#a4)

We review all businesses using Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS) to check you are doing the right thing. Your obligations for CCeS include:

-   getting customer consent
-   staff access
-   telling us about changes to your business
-   privacy
-   security.

## Customer consent

You must get a customer’s consent before you use CCeS. It is voluntary and customers can withdraw their consent at any time. You must also:

-   get consent from every customer you want to use CCeS for
-   make sure you confirm the identity of the customer before you get consent or use CCeS
-   keep consent records for 2 years from the last time you gave your customer a concession, rebate, or service
-   ensure your consent record uses wording described in the [CCeS procedural guide](/centrelink-confirmation-eservices-policy-terms-and-procedural-guide?context=23236).

## Staff access

You must train new staff in all aspects of using CCeS before they access CCeS.

Always use your own logon ID and password - don’t share these.

Tell us immediately if any staff no longer need access to CCeS. We’ll remove their access.

## Changes to your business

Tell us about changes to your business. This includes changes to your:

-   business structure or practices
-   contact details, including authorised and contact officers.

## Privacy and security

You must comply with privacy and secrecy legislation for personal, protected and confidential information. This means you can’t:

-   access any records without a business need
-   use the customer’s Customer Reference Number (CRN) for any purpose other than for CCeS data exchange
-   share customer information without their consent
-   access your own information or the information of people you know
-   allow access to information to any unauthorised person.

You must tell us of any security incidents such as unauthorised disclosure.

Store customer details in a locked cabinet or secure database.

Make sure you can find consent records at review time.
