# When you can access

You can use your online account 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Keep in mind, there may be short interruptions to your access when we’re updating the service. Check [customer service changes](/customer-service-changes) for any scheduled service interruptions.

## Session timeout

If you don’t use your account for more than 14 minutes, your session will time out.

Before it times out, you’ll see a message on the page. Select **Stay logged in** when you see the **Your session is about to expire** message. If your session does expire, you’ll be returned to your myGov homepage.

This is a security measure to protect your information.
