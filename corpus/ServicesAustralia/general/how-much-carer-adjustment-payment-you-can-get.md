# How much you can get

You can get a one-off payment to help care for your child.

Carer Adjustment Payment is a one-off payment up to $10,000 for each child affected by a catastrophic event. How much you get depends on your family’s circumstances.

When you claim, we’ll ask you some questions to understand your circumstances and work out how much you can get.

This payment is not taxable and doesn’t need to be included in your tax return.
