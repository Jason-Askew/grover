# How much you can get

The amount of ABSTUDY School Fees Allowance at home rate we pay depends on the student’s age.

-   [Rates per year](#a1)
-   [How we pay](#a2)

We pay School Fees Allowance at home rate until the year the student turns 16.

## Rates per year

There are 2 maximum rates. These are the most we can pay for a student living at home.

If the student

Maximum rate of School Fees Allowance

is younger than 16 on 30 June in the year of study

$156 a year

is turning 16 before 1 July in the year of study

$78 a year

If the school fees are less than the maximum rate, we’ll pay enough to cover them. If the fees are more than the maximum rate, you’ll have to pay the difference. We only pay the maximum rate per year.

## How we pay

We’ll pay the allowance to the school when the student starts, unless you choose to pay the fees yourself.

If you pay the fees yourself, we’ll pay the allowance to you after you’ve given us proof of payment.

We pay the allowance annually.
