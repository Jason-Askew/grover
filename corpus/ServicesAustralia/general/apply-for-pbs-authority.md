# Apply for PBS Authority

There are several ways to apply for a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) authority approval for Authority Required Drugs.

You can get authority approval online, by submitting a form or by calling us.

Find out more about the [drugs, programs or conditions](/drug-program-or-condition-for-pbs-medicines?context=20) that need authority approval.

There are also emergency provision arrangements to prescribe an authority required item if our phone lines or systems are down.

When you apply for authority approval, please be aware we can’t approve a medication if your patient does not meet all the criteria outlined in the PBS schedule.

When prescribing for a Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) patient, you’ll need to seek authority approval from DVA for Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) prescriptions by submitting a form or by calling DVA. Find out more about [prior approval of prescriptions](https://www.dva.gov.au/providers/information-for-gps-other-primary-care-providers/medicines/pharmacy-information-for-providers#prior-approval-of-prescriptions) for RPBS patients on the DVA website.

Online

You can submit a request for many of the Authority Required Drugs using the Online PBS Authorities system.

You’ll need to use your individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to securely access government online services. If you don’t have a PRODA account, [register for one](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Once registered, you’ll need to link your prescriber number in your PRODA account.

You can then access the Online PBS Authorities system through either:

-   Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)
-   upgraded clinical and prescribing software.

To request an authority using the Online PBS Authorities system you’ll need to:

-   provide information about your patient
-   tell us the medicine you’re prescribing including dose, quantity and repeats
-   answer questions and attach supporting documents such as test results or images where required.

To apply online follow these steps:

Step 1: Log in to PRODA to use HPOS, select **My programs** then **PBS authorities**.

Step 2: Select **Request authority** to begin.

Step 3: Search for your patients details by entering their **Medicare number**, then select **Next**.

Step 4: Select the **PBS item being prescribed**, enter **prescription details** including the dose and dose frequency, then select **Next**.

You need to enter the dose as the number of tablets, capsules, injections and not the strength of the medication. For example, if your patient takes 1 x 150 mg tablet daily, enter the dose as 1, not 150.

Step 5: Select the relevant **Restriction code** check box, then select **Next**. For streamlined items, write the **Streamlined authority code** on the PBS prescription. You can then **Exit** the authority application.

Step 6: Answer **Questions about the PBS restriction**, then select **Next**.

Step 7: If required, **Attach supporting documents**, then select **Next**.

If you select **Save**, you can view the documents to confirm you’ve uploaded the correct files.

Step 8: Review your application. Update the Authority Prescription Number, then tick the **Declaration statement check box** and select **Submit**. You’ll receive either a real time patient eligibility assessment result of Approved or Rejected or a status of Awaiting Assessment. If the online authority request has a status of Awaiting Assessment, we need to review the authority request. You’ll receive the assessment outcome in your HPOS mailbox. Find out more about [PBS reason codes for online PBS authorities](/pbs-reason-codes-for-online-pbs-authorities?context=20).

Step 9: If the application is approved, endorse the prescription with the **PBS authority approval number** and **PBS item code**.
