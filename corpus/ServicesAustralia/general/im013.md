# Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) - immunisation history form (IM013)

Use this form if you don’t have access to the AIR site or vaccination software. You can update an individual’s immunisation history for immunisations given by other vaccination providers.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

If you’re an eligible health professional (or their HPOS delegate), you can quickly update an individual’s immunisation history (including overseas vaccinations) by using either:

-   the AIR site using [HPOS](/hpos) (you’ll need an individual [PRODA](/what-services-you-can-access-with-proda) account)
-   vaccination reporting software.

If you need help linking your HPOS account to the AIR, call the [AIR Internet helpdesk](/health-professionals-contact-information#acir). For help with PRODA, call the [PRODA helpdesk](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).

If you’re unsure whether your software can transmit immunisation history, contact your software developer

If you submit using the [form upload function in HPOS](/upload-forms-hpos) Messages:

-   it must be lodged using the HPOS account of the health professional completing the form, or their nominated HPOS delegate
-   it can take up to 14 days to update an individual’s AIR record
-   we may need to contact you to confirm the details.
