# Replace your Medicare card or get an extra card

You can get a new Medicare card if it expires or is lost, stolen or damaged. You can also get an extra card.

## Replacing your lost, stolen or damaged card

If your Medicare card is lost, stolen or damaged, you can ask for a new card. You can do this using:

-   your [Medicare online account](/medicare-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **my card**.
3.  Select **get a replacement** and follow the prompts.

[Sign into myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline%2F%23%2Fextlnk%2Fcard)

You can also call the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone).

You can use a digital copy of your new Medicare card straight away in the myGov app. Find out [how to get a digital card](/how-to-access-your-digital-medicare-card?context=21796).

If there’s more than one person on the card, only one person needs to get a replacement card.

## Replacing your expired card

We’ll send you a new card about 4 to 8 weeks before your current card expires. You don’t need to do anything. We’ll send it to the address we have for you.

It’s important to tell us when you change address. If you don’t and your card expires, your card will go to your previous address. Read more about how to [update your Medicare details](/how-you-update-your-name-date-birth-or-gender-for-medicare).

If you don’t get your card, you can ask for a new one by:

-   using your [Medicare online account](/medicare-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   calling the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone).

You can read our [step-by-step guide to getting a replacement card](/medicare-online-account-help-get-replacement-or-extra-medicare-card).

You can use a digital copy of your Medicare card in the meantime. Read more about [how to get a digital card](/how-to-access-your-digital-medicare-card?context=21796).

## Getting an extra card

Your family can get a second card with the same details. We provide an extra card when more than one family member needs a card. We can only issue one extra card.

If someone in your family is 15 or older, they may want to get their own card. Read more about [getting your own Medicare card](/have-your-own-medicare-card-and-number-if-youre-15-or-older-and-enrolled-medicare?context=21796). We can’t issue an extra card when you’re the only person on your card.

You can ask for an extra card for your family by:

-   using your [Medicare online account](/medicare-online-account) through [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
-   the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app)
-   calling the [Medicare program](#toolbar-phone).

We’ll send your extra card to the address you give us, in 3 to 4 weeks.

You can [read our step-by-step guide to getting an extra card](/medicare-online-account-help-get-replacement-or-extra-medicare-card).

You can also use a digital copy of your Medicare card. Read more about [how to get a digital card](/how-to-access-your-digital-medicare-card?context=21796).
