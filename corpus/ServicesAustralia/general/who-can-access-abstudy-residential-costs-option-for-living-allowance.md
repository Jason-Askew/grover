# Who can access it

You may be able to access the residential costs option if you’re doing approved higher education study and meet some requirements.

To access the residential costs option, you must be either a:

-   tertiary student
-   secondary student doing approved study at a university.

You must also meet all of the following:

-   getting ABSTUDY Living Allowance or ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement
-   approved for a higher rate of ABSTUDY while living away from home
-   living in a residential college attached to an Australian education institution or in a hostel.

If you got the [Relocation Scholarship](/relocation-scholarship), you’re only able to access the residential costs option if both the following apply:

-   you’re offered a place in a residential college
-   we’ve already paid you the scholarship.

## Example if you got the Relocation Scholarship and live in a residential college

John got a Relocation Scholarship on 21 February 2022. On 20 March 2022, the residential college offered him accommodation on campus. He accepted it and moved into the college on 25 March 2022.

John can access the residential costs option. This is because he got an offer for a place at the college after he got the Relocation Scholarship.
