# Early release of superannuation

You can access your superannuation (super) early in limited circumstances. This includes if you’re in severe financial hardship.

Your super fund makes decisions about early access to super and decides if you’re in financial hardship. They make these decisions according to the legislative requirements in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994.

We don’t make these decisions.

Read more about the [Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994](https://www.legislation.gov.au/details/f2022c00954) on the Federal Register of Legislation website.

If your super fund needs proof you’ve been getting income support payments from us for a specific time, we can give you a letter. Your super fund might call it a Q230 or Q251 letter. The letter doesn’t guarantee your super fund will release your super early.

Some super funds can check if you’ve been getting an income support payment from us online. If you agree for them to do this, they use our Centrelink Confirmation eServices (CCeS).

You can also apply for early access to your super for some other reasons including compassionate grounds.

## Financial impact of getting your super early
