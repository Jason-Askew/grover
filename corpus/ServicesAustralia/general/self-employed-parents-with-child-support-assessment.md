# Self employed parents

If you're self employed and pay child support through us, you can use most payment methods.

-   [Income](#a2)

Read more about [payment methods](/choose-how-to-pay-child-support?context=21911).

## Overdue payments

If you have [overdue payments](/recovering-child-and-spousal-support-payments?context=21911) we try to agree with you on a plan to pay back the debt.

If we can’t make a plan we can send a garnishee notice. This requires someone to pay money to us instead of paying it to you.

For example, it could be a business you work for on contract. We can tell them to do this for a one off amount, a regular payment, or a number of cents per dollar.

## Income

We use your income to work out how much child support you should pay or receive. When you’re self employed you can legally reduce your taxable income by claiming some expenses as tax deductions.

This may mean you have more financial resources than your taxable income shows.

Read about [income we use to work out child support](/how-your-income-affects-your-child-support?context=21911).

## Assessment changes

We can change your child support in special circumstances if you have more financial resources than your taxable income shows.

Either parent can also apply. Read about [changing your child support assessment in special circumstances](/changing-your-child-support-assessment-special-circumstances?context=21911).
