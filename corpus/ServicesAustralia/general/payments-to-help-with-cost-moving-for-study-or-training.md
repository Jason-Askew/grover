If you get one of the following payments:

-   Youth Allowance for students and apprentices
-   Austudy
-   ABSTUDY.

You may be eligible for further payments to help with the cost of moving for study or training.

They can be used for expenses like travel, rent and living costs.

You need to make a claim for some of these payments to get them.
