# Change of circumstances

You need to tell us if your circumstances change. This is to make sure you’re still eligible for a Low Income Health Care Card.

For example, you must tell us if any of the following occurs:

-   you [change or correct your name](#changename)
-   your personal circumstances change
-   you change your address
-   [you sell your principal home](/real-estate-assets?context=21986#ifyousellyourprincipalhome)
-   your income changes
-   your care arrangements change
-   your work or study load changes.

## How and when to tell us

The easiest way to tell us about changes is [online](/self-service).

You can also call the [Youth and Students line](#toolbar-phone) to replace your card or visit a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

You need to tell us about the changes within 14 days.

If you don’t tell us about changes, we may stop your card when we find out about them. If you deliberately don’t tell us, we could charge you with [fraud](/report-fraud).

Read about [how to avoid fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud).

### Changing or correcting your name

It’s important to tell us if you [change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
