The Tertiary Access Payment (TAP) is a one off payment of up to $5,000. It’s to help eligible students with the cost of moving to study. This is for study after you’ve finished year 12 or equivalent.

To get the payment you must move from a regional or remote area for tertiary study.

Regional areas are places that aren’t in or near a major city. You can check if your [family home](/family-home-location-for-tertiary-access-payment?context=53447) is in a regional or remote area using the Student Regional Area Search.

You can still claim TAP if you get ABSTUDY, Youth Allowance or Relocation Scholarship in your first year of study.
