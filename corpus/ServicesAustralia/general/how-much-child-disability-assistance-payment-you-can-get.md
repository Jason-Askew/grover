# How much you can get

You can get up to $1,000 each year for each child who qualifies you for Carer Allowance.

## on this page

-   [Shared care](#a1)
-   [If your payment is income managed](#a2)

If you’re getting [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance), you can get this payment for each eligible child. For example, if you get Carer Allowance for 2 children, you’ll get 2 payments.

## Shared care

Under shared care arrangements, we’ll divide your payment in the same way we divide your [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance).

## If your payment is income managed

The full amount you get will go into either your:

-   [Income Management](/income-management-and-basicscard) account which you can access using your BasicsCard if you have one
-   [Enhanced Income Management](/enhanced-income-management-and-smartcard) account which you can access using your SmartCard.
