You need to meet certain criteria to be eligible for the Additional Child Care Subsidy Child Wellbeing.

-   in formal foster care or formal kinship placement
-   in the care of the state, territory or the Minister.

Your child care service is responsible for applying for the Child Wellbeing subsidy on your behalf. Speak to your child care service for help to support your child’s wellbeing or to apply for this additional subsidy.
