# Verification of voluntary work form (SU462)

Job seekers and voluntary work organisations can use this form.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

You can download and complete the [Verification of voluntary work form](/sites/default/files/2025-05/su462-2504en-f.pdf "PDF document").

Ask the voluntary work organisation to complete page 2 of the form. They must complete this for it to be approved. Not all voluntary work activities can be approved. To help us understand if the work meets the voluntary work criteria, we may ask the organisation to provide supporting documents.

You can refer to a Service Officer for more information.
