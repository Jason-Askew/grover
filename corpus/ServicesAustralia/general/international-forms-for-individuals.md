## Centrelink forms if you live outside Australia

You can claim a Centrelink payment if you’re living in a country we have an agreement with. If you claim a Centrelink payment while living in a country we don’t have an agreement with, we’ll reject it.

You can submit a claim up to 13 weeks early. If you’re eligible, we’ll normally pay you from the date you submit your claim or are eligible. We’ll pay you from whichever is the later date. Call one of our [International numbers](#toolbar-phone) to tell us that you’re going to make a claim. Submit your claim as soon as possible after you call us. That way we can pay you from the earliest possible date.

The forms you need to complete depend on the payment you’re claiming. If you live overseas, download the relevant claim forms from the list below. Fill them in and submit them with the pension fund or social security office in the agreement country. They will help you to confirm your identity and copy original documents. The details are on the form.
