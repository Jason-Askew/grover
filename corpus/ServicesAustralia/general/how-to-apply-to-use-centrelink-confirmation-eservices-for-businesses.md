We may contact you to ask for more details about your application.

We'll send you a letter advising the outcome of your application.

If we approve your application, we’ll give you information about how to use CCeS. This includes how you should get a customer’s consent.

If we don’t approve your application and you think we’ve made a mistake, ask us to review our decision. To do this, contact us using the details in the letter we sent you.
