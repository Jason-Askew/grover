# What you need to do

The agreement can include payment of cash or non-cash items, such as school fees and health insurance.

You must have a child support assessment in place before we can accept a limited child support agreement. The payments set out in the agreement must be equal to, or more than, the annual rate in the [assessment](/child-support-assessment). We don’t require you to get legal advice before making your agreement, but you can choose to do so.

A parent must have at least 35% care of a child to receive child support under an agreement. Read more about [how your percentage of care affects your child support payments](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-family-tax-benefit-ftb-payments).

When we’ve accepted a limited child support agreement, receiving parents can choose between either:

-   [private collect](/private-collect)
-   [child support collect](/child-support-collect).

As a parent, you must do all of the following:

-   pay your child support in full and on time if you’re the paying parent
-   make sure you tell us what care arrangements are in place for your children
-   lodge your tax return on time
-   report your income accurately
-   tell us about any [changes of circumstances](/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21921).

Changes to the care arrangements can affect a child support assessment. You need to tell us about changes straight away. If you don’t tell us within 28 days any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.

Changes to care arrangements can also impact a child support agreement.

Find out more about [how to tell us if your child’s care arrangements change](/child-support-payments-and-care-arrangements?context=21911#howtotellus).

If you can’t agree to make a limited agreement with the other parent, you can seek legal advice about a [binding child support agreement](/binding-child-support-agreement).
