# Payment options

We’ll pay these to you based on your payment choice for Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A.

## on this page

-   [When FTB Part A is claimed fortnightly](#a1)
-   [When FTB Part A is claimed as a lump sum](#a2)
-   [How to manage your money](#a3)

## When FTB Part A is claimed fortnightly

If you choose to get FTB Part A or the base rate fortnightly, you’ll get both:

-   Newborn Upfront Payment as a lump sum
-   Newborn Supplement with your regular FTB Part A payment.

If you claim FTB Part A fortnightly at a zero rate, you’ll get both payments after the end of the financial year when we balance your payments.

Read more about [payment choices for FTB](/payment-choices-for-ftb).

## When FTB Part A is claimed as a lump sum

If you choose to get FTB Part A as a lump sum after the end of the financial year, you’ll get both payments as part of that lump sum payment.

## How to manage your money

These payments may be subject to [Income Management](/income-management-and-basicscard).
