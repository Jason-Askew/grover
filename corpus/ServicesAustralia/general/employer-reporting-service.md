# Employer reporting service

This service enables Australian Disability Enterprises (ADE) employers to report income information for their employees directly to us.

-   [How to Register](#a2)

Your employee’s income from ADE work may affect the rate of payment that they get from us. We need to confirm their employment income to ensure they get the correct payment amount each fortnight.

The service is for our customers who are working in ADE, and get an income support payment from us including:

-   Disability Support Pension
-   Age Pension.

## Employer Reporting service is voluntary

To use this service, your employees need to provide written consent. It’s essential they understand that it’s not compulsory. If your eligible employee consents to participate, they or their nominee should:

-   contact us if there are changes in their payments that they don’t understand
-   declare other types of income including earnings from other employers and financial investments
-   tell us of any change in their circumstances
-   tell us if they no longer want to use the Employer Reporting service.

ADE employees who don’t use the Employer Reporting service still need to report their employment income to Services Australia. Read more about how your employees can [report employment income](/employment-income-reporting?context=22276).

## How to Register

Our [National Business Gateway](/business-and-employer-contact-information?context=60075) staff can help you with registration for this service and any other questions you may have. When you call them please have your business name and Business Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN) ready. It’s okay if you don’t have one.

You’ll also need to complete and give us some documents to register. You can get these from the [National Business Gateway](/business-and-employer-contact-information?context=60075#businessgateway) team by calling or emailing [national.business.gateway@servicesaustralia.gov.au](mailto:national.business.gateway@servicesaustralia.gov.au).

Once you have applied for the program, the team may contact your business to discuss the registration assessment if needed.
