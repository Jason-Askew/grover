You need to sign in through myGov to set up and use your Medicare online account.

Follow these steps to get online.

## Step 1: check you’re enrolled in Medicare

You need to be enrolled in Medicare to set up your Medicare online account. If you have a [Medicare card](/your-medicare-card) or number, you’re already enrolled. If you don’t, find out [how to enrol](/enrolling-medicare#howtoenrol).

## Step 2: sign in through myGov

You need to sign in through myGov and link Medicare to create your Medicare online account.

If you already have a myGov account:

[Sign in to myGov](https://my.gov.au)

If you don’t have one, learn [how to create a myGov account](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account) on the myGov website.

## Step 3: link Medicare to your myGov account

After you sign in to the myGov website, select **View and link services**, then the **Medicare** link button.

If you’re using the myGov app, select **Services**, then the **plus** icon, then **Medicare** from the list.

We’ll ask you some questions to make sure it’s you. It’ll take about 10 minutes and you’ll need your Medicare card.

We may ask questions about your last visit to your doctor such as the:

-   date of your visit
-   location of the medical practice
-   name of your doctor.

You’ll know you’re set up when you can see Medicare as a linked service in your myGov account.

If you need help you can do any of the following:

-   read the [help pages](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help) on the myGov website
-   learn more about [Medicare online account](/medicare-online-account)
-   call the [Medicare program line](#toolbar-phone) for general enquiries.

## Step 4: download the myGov app

When you’ve linked your Medicare online account to myGov, you can use the myGov app. The app makes it easier to access Medicare services and claim online.

Find out more about the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app).
