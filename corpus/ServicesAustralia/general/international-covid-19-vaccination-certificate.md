# International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate

If you’re travelling overseas, you don’t need an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate.

You no longer need an International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate to travel outside of Australia.

Ask your doctor about any vaccinations you may need for the country you’re travelling to. The smartraveller website also has information on [vaccinations you may need to travel](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/before-you-go/health/diseases).

For travel advice go to [Smartraveller.gov.au](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/).
