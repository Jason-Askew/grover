There are things you need to do to manage your allowance.

You need to:

-   [report the income you’ve earned](/employment-income-reporting?context=45541) every 2 weeks even if it’s $0, if you’re an apprentice
-   [report how much you’ve earned](/employment-income-reporting?context=45541) every 2 weeks, if you’re a student earning income
-   tell us about any [changes to your circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-abstudy-living-allowance?context=45541)
-   complete an [online review of your study details](/online-review-study-details?context=45541) when we ask

-   get your [parents or guardians to update their income details](/annual-parental-income-reassessment?context=45541) each year, if you’re dependent.
