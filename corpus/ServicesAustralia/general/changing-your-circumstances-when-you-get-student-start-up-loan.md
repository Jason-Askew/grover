# Changing your circumstances

It’s important to tell us if your circumstances change when you get a Student Start-up Loan.

## on this page

-   [What to tell us](#a1)
-   [How to tell us](#a2)

## What to tell us

You need to tell us if there are changes to:

-   your personal and contact details
-   your bank details
-   your [relationship changes](/relationship-changes), for example if you become partnered or separated
-   your study, including any changes to your study load.

If you change courses and are still eligible for the loan, you’ll need to update your study details then re-apply for it.

You need to tell us about a change in your circumstances within 14 days. If you don’t, we may pay you too much and you may have to [pay back the money](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink?context=60271).

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us about changes to your circumstances online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also tell us using either:

-   the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   [Centrelink phone self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

Read more about what you can do using [self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

If you don’t have access to a self service option please call the [Youth and students line](#toolbar-phone).

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Youth and students line

Use this line for help with payments for students, apprentices and trainees of any age, job seekers under 22 and help with a Low Income Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[132 490](tel:132490)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm

If your payment has stopped, it may be because we need your parents’ or guardians’ income information. Read more about how they can [update their income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

If you need help with an ABSTUDY payment call the [ABSTUDY line](/phone-us#abstudy).

#### Waiting on your claim to be processed?

Claims take longer to process at the beginning of the semester when a lot of people claim at once.

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
