# What’s covered

Find out what child dental services we cover and how much we cover.

We cover up to $1,158 for each eligible child over 2 calendar years for basic dental services under CDBS. The cap amount is indexed yearly on 1 January. The increase in cap amount will only apply to a child or teenager who received their first eligible service in that calendar year. The services we’ll cover include any of these:

-   check-ups
-   X-rays
-   cleaning
-   fissure sealing
-   fillings
-   root canals
-   extractions.

There are some restrictions for basic dental services. You should check with your dentist if there are any item or time restrictions before starting your service.

These services don’t count towards the threshold of both the:

-   [Medicare Safety Net](/medicare-safety-nets)
-   [Extended Medicare Safety Net](/what-are-medicare-safety-nets-thresholds).

The services we won’t cover are all of the following:

-   orthodontic dental work
-   cosmetic dental work
-   any dental services in a hospital.

## The 2 year period

You can claim up to $1,158 for each eligible child over 2 consecutive calendar years.

The 2 year period starts at the beginning of the calendar year in which your child both:

-   becomes eligible
-   gets their first dental service.

You can use the full amount up to $1,158 for each eligible child in the first calendar year. This will leave no funds for the second year. If you don’t use the full $1,158 in the first year, you can use it in the second year if your child is still [eligible](/who-can-get-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426).

If you don’t use the full amount within the 2 calendar years, you can’t use the remaining funds. You’ll have to wait for a new 2 year cover period to start.

You also won’t be able to use any remaining funds once your child is no longer eligible.

### Example of claiming CDBS services

During 2024 Lia got the Parenting Payment. This meant her daughter Rachel was eligible for dental benefits for the year from 1 January 2024. She was eligible again in 2025 because Lia also got the Parenting Payment that year.

Lia claimed child dental benefits for Rachel in 2024 and 2025. By 31 December 2024 we had paid $840 of Rachel’s $1,095 limit. Lia can use the remaining $255 balance in 2025 because she received parenting payment in 2025 and Rachel remained eligible for CDBS.

In 2026 Lia got the Parenting Payment again. This made Rachel eligible for a new 2 year period of dental cover from 1 January 2026. Lia can use up to $1,158 of dental benefits for Rachel for that period. But she can only continue to use it in 2027 if Lia gets an eligible payment that year.
