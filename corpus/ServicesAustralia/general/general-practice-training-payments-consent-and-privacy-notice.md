## General Practice Training Payments consent notice

If you register for General Practice Training Payments (GPTP), we’ll collect and use information about you to facilitate payments. This includes identifiers such as Medicare Provider Numbers or Medicare STEM.

We’ll verify your identifier against your Medicare provider record, which is protected information under the _Health Insurance Act 1973_ _(Cth)_. We only record, communicate or share this information with your consent, or as otherwise authorised under the Health Insurance Act.

Identifiers are unique to individuals and are used to link the GPTP to the correct individual. This ensures we pay the correct payment to the correct person. If we don't use your identifier, we may not be able to pay you GPTP.

We also record, communicate and share your identifier when we create internal monitoring reports, which ensures the integrity of payments. This information may also be reported to the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing who is responsible for GPTP policy.

If you register for GPTP, you’ll be consenting to Services Australia recording and communicating your identifier and payment information to facilitate your payments.

Refer to the GPTP privacy notice for more information about how we handle personal information.
