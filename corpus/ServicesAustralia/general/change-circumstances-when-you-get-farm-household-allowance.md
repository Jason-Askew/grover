## How and when to tell us

You need to tell us if your circumstances change within 14 days. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **My details**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

For help, use our guide to [manage your income and assets details](/centrelink-online-account-help-manage-your-income-and-assets-details) using your Centrelink online account.

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

It’s never too late to report a change.

### Changing or correcting your name

It’s important to tell us if you [change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink?context=64107).

## What happens if you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about changes in your life, we may pay you too much. If this happens, you must pay the money back. Read more about [Centrelink debts and overpayments](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments).

If you don’t tell us when your circumstances change, you could be committing [fraud](/report-fraud).
