# How to register an organisation

To access an available service on behalf of an organisation, you must register your organisation in PRODA.

## on this page

-   [Before you register](#a1)
-   [Register using RAM](#a2)
-   [Register using ABR](#a3)
-   [Set up your organisation functions](#a4)

You can register an organisation in PRODA using either:

-   [Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM)](https://info.authorisationmanager.gov.au/)
-   [Australian Business Register (ABR)](https://www.abr.gov.au/).

## Before you register

Before you can register an organisation in PRODA, you must make sure that:

-   you’ve [registered an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account?context=33786)
-   you’re an Associate or Authorised contact for the organisation on the [ABR](https://www.abr.gov.au/)
-   your individual PRODA account name matches your name as recorded on the ABR.

Your organisation must also have an active Australian Business Number (ABN). You need to contact the ABR if you need to update your name or organisation information recorded on the ABR.

If you want to register multiple organisations in PRODA, you’ll have to register each organisation individually.

## Register using RAM

Follow these steps to register your organisation in PRODA using RAM.

You need to first link your [Digital ID](https://www.digitalidsystem.gov.au/) to your organisation’s ABN in the RAM and be listed as a [Principal Authority](https://info.authorisationmanager.gov.au/principal-authority).

### Step 1: Confirm digital identity details

Log in to your individual PRODA account using your Digital ID, then select **Organisations**. Select **Register New Organisation** and then **Continue with RAM** to begin the process.

Select your digital identity provider and check the details on the consent page.

### Step 2: Verify the organisation email

We’ll send an activation code to your organisation email address. To finalise the organisation registration, enter the code in the **Email code field**.

We’ll confirm you’ve successfully registered the organisation in PRODA by email. It will include the Registration Authority (RA) number which is unique to the organisation. You can give this to the PRODA Helpdesk if you need support.

## Register using ABR

Follow these steps to register your organisation in PRODA using ABR.

### Step 1: Create account using your organisation details

Log in to your individual PRODA account, then select **Organisations**. Select **Register New Organisatio**n and then **Continue with ABR** to begin the process.

You’ll need to enter the following details:

-   name of the organisation
-   ABN of the organisation
-   organisation contact email address.

Your individual PRODA account name must match the Associate or Authorised contact name for the organisation on the ABR. If they don’t match, you won’t be able to go to the next step.

### Step 2: Answer ownership questions

You’ll need to answer 3 proof of ownership questions. The questions are from non-publicly available information about the organisation on the ABR.

Your answers to all 3 questions must match the information on the ABR. You won’t be able to go to the next step if they don’t.

You should contact the ABR if you need either:

-   help with your answers
-   to update the information recorded on the ABR.

You can view or update your ABN details online using [myID](https://www.myid.gov.au/). For more information and assistance visit the [ABR website](https://www.abr.gov.au/) or [contact them](https://www.abr.gov.au/contact-us/contact-abr).

### Step 3: Verify the organisation email

We’ll send an activation code to your organisation email address. To finalise the organisation registration, enter the code in the **Email code field**.

We’ll confirm you’ve successfully registered the organisation in PRODA by email. It will include the Registration Authority (RA) number which is unique to the organisation. You can give this to the PRODA Helpdesk if you need support.

## Set up your organisation functions

You’ll now see your organisation as active on **My Organisations**.

When you select the organisation name, you’ll be able to set up and manage your organisation functions. You can read our guides to:

-   [add members and manage their delegations](/managing-members-and-delegations-organisation-proda?context=33786) to perform functions on your organisation’s behalf
-   [nominate members to act on your behalf](/managing-nominee-delegations-proda?context=33786) with the service provider
-   [add subsidiary organisations](/registering-subsidiary-organisations-proda?context=33786) to allow areas of your organisation to interact with the service provider independently
-   [add and link a service provider](/adding-service-providers-to-your-organisation-proda?context=33786) to your organisation in PRODA
-   [add a B2B device](/managing-b2b-devices-proda?context=33786) to use a software product to access a service provider.

If you need assistance with linking to a [service provider](/what-services-you-can-access-with-proda?context=33786), you’ll need to contact that service provider for support.

If you need help with PRODA, you can call or email the [PRODA team](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).
