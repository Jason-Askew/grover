# Who gets it

You can no longer start Income Management in Shepparton, Victoria. But if you started it before 4 September 2023 you can continue on Income Management.

You can keep using your Income Management account and BasicsCard if any of these applied to you before 4 September 2023:

-   a social worker referred you or you were identified as a vulnerable young person
-   you volunteered for Income Management
-   you were referred by a State or Territory Child Protection Authority.

If you have a payment nominee who is on Income Management, it may affect your payment.

If you are on Income Management, you have the option to move to enhanced Income Management with an [enhanced Income Management account and a SmartCard](/enhanced-income-management-and-smartcard).

If you choose not to move, you will stay on Income Management and can keep using your BasicsCard if you have one. But, if your circumstances change, you might need to move to enhanced Income Management later.
