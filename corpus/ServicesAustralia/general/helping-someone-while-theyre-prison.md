# Helping someone while they’re in prison

Corrective services can help our customers who are in prison access services and some payments.

## on this page

-   [Set up a nominee](#a1)
-   [Claim a payment](#a2)
-   [Start the Reconnection, Employment and Learning (REAL) Program](#a3)
-   [Update details with Medicare](#a4)

During their time in prison, our customers may need help to apply for payments and services and update their details with us.

## Set up a nominee

Our customer may set up a nominee to complete their Centrelink, Medicare and child support business on their behalf when they have entered prison.

### Centrelink nominee

They may want to nominate someone or an organisation to act on their behalf with Centrelink while they’re in prison, this is called a nominee arrangement. Use the [Authorising a person or organisation to enquire or act on your behalf form](/ss313).

### Medicare representative

To nominate a person or organisation to act on their behalf with Medicare while they’re in prison, use the [Authorisation to act on an incapacitated person’s behalf for Medicare purposes form](/mo050).

### Child support representative

They can authorise a person or organisation to enquire or act on their behalf for child support while they’re in prison, use the [Representative authority form](/cs3042).

## Claim a payment

Some people who are incarcerated may be eligible for payments while they’re in prison.

### ABSTUDY

[ABSTUDY Lawful Custody Allowance](/abstudy-lawful-custody-allowance-for-education-providers-and-corrective-services) is for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who are in custody and studying or training. The allowance can help with essential course costs.

### Family Tax Benefit

If they have children in their care while they’re in prison, they might be able to continue to get Family Assistance to help them. They can contact us on the dedicated prison phone line.

### Disability Support Pension

If they’re in psychiatric confinement and meet certain conditions, they might be able to get Disability Support Pension (DSP).

They should read the rules for getting DSP before [claiming](/before-claiming-disability-support-pension).

They’ll need to complete the [Customer in psychiatric confinement form](/sa379).

To support their claim for DSP, they may need to also complete a [Consent to disclose medical information form](/sa472). This confirms a customer’s consent for their health provider to disclose their medical information to us.

### Child support arrangements

If they pay or receive child support, they’ll need to confirm they’ve entered prison to avoid getting a debt.

They can call the Child Support phone line.

To ensure their child support assessment is up to date and based on their current circumstances, they may need your help to submit extra forms:

-   [Representative authority form](/cs3042)
-   [Income declaration form](/cs1668)
-   [Application for fixed annual rate not to be used form](/cs4119)
-   [Application to reduce minimum assessment to nil form](/cs2840)
-   [Estimate of income for use in Child Support Assessment form](/cs1670).

## Start the Reconnection, Employment and Learning (REAL) Program

The REAL Program helps people access training, education and mentoring while they’re in prison and after they’re released.

It’s voluntary and open to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians aged 15 or older who have a known release date or are on remand. They can start the program up to 6 months before their release.

If they start the program before leaving prison, they can stay in the program for up to 12 months after leaving prison. This can help them meet their mutual obligation requirements if they’re getting a payment from us, such as JobSeeker Payment.

Read more about the [REAL Program](https://www.dewr.gov.au/reconnection-employment-and-learning-real-program) on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website.

## Update details with Medicare

They can call us on the dedicated prison phone line to both:

-   get their Medicare number
-   update their Medicare information.

If they need a new Medicare card, they might need help to submit one of these forms:

-   [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004)
-   [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicare enrolment and amendment form](/ms018)
-   [Application to copy or transfer from one Medicare card to another form](/ms011).
