# If your partner has employment income

Your partner’s assessable income may also change with the Work Bonus.

This can happen if both of these apply:

-   they’re a pensioner of [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension?context=22526#whatagepensionis)
-   they earn money from work.

You can’t use your Work Bonus for your partner’s wages or self-employment income. However, applying the Work Bonus to your wages or self-employment income earned from [active participation](/types-income-we-apply-work-bonus-to?context=22561#activeparticipation) will affect your combined income. This means your partner may benefit from the reduced amount of your assessable income for the income test.
