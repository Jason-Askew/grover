To contact us through the NRS:

2.  Give the NRS the phone number you’d like to call.

You can also contact their [National Relay Service Helpdesk](https://www.accesshub.gov.au/about-the-nrs/nrs-helpdesk) for assistance.

#### TTY

We also provide a free direct call TTY service for people who are deaf, have hearing loss or a speech disability. To use this service, you can call us on 1800 810 586. A tele-typewriter phone is required to access this service.

### Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP)

Phone numbers starting with '13' may not be available from VOIP services. Please ask your service provider for more information. If your VOIP service isn't available you can try using a land line.

### Call costs

Phone service providers charge a fixed rate for calls from your home phone to 13 numbers from anywhere in Australia. That rate may vary from the price of a local call and may vary between telephone service providers. Calls to 1800 numbers from your home phone are free. Phone service providers may time calls from public and mobile phones and charge them at a higher rate.

## Help with forms

If you can’t complete a form you can nominate [someone to act on your behalf](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support). If you can’t do this, you can ask for help at one of our [service centres](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).
