# When you can access it

You can use your online account 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We’re available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Keep in mind, there may be short interruptions to your access when we are updating the service. We do this between 2 am and 5 am AEST.

Check [customer service changes](/customer-service-changes) for any scheduled service interruptions.

## Session timeout

If you don’t use your account for more than 14 minutes, your session will time out.

You’ll see a message on the screen. Select **OK** when you see the sign out message. Sign in again.

This is a security measure to protect your information.
