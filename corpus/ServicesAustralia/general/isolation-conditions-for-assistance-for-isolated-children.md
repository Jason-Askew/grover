# Isolation conditions

To get Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC), your child must meet certain isolation conditions.

They only need to meet 1 and they may include:

-   being [geographically isolated](/geographically-isolated-conditions-for-assistance-for-isolated-children?context=22121)
-   having a [special education need](/disability-or-special-education-need-conditions-for-assistance-for-isolated-children?context=22121)
-   [not having access to a suitable government school](/no-reasonable-access-to-school-conditions-for-assistance-for-isolated-children?context=22121).
