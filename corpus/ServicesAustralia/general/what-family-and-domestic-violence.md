Family and domestic violence can affect anyone in all types of relationships. It can occur in:

-   past or current intimate relationships, including relationships where you are dating or living together, regardless of gender or sexuality
-   relationships involving carers of people with a disability or a medical condition, or elders
-   relationships with relatives and guardians
-   culturally recognised family groups.

Family and domestic violence isn’t always physical. It can happen to anyone, no matter their age, gender or sexual orientation.

It can continue even when you’ve left a violent relationship.

Family and domestic violence is always the fault of the person causing the abuse. It’s never the fault of the person experiencing abusive behaviour.
