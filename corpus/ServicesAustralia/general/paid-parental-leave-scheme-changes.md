# Paid Parental Leave scheme changes

There are some changes if you get Paid Parental Leave. You now get superannuation paid on your Parental Leave Pay.

## Superannuation for Parental Leave Pay

If you get Parental Leave Pay for a child born or adopted from 1 July 2025, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will pay a 12% superannuation contribution on this payment. This will be paid directly to your superannuation fund. Contributions will be paid after the end of the financial year you got Parental Leave Pay, starting in July 2026.

Once you’ve done your Parental Leave Pay claim, you don’t need to do anything further. Your superannuation contribution will be paid automatically.

If you share Parental Leave Pay with another person, each person is eligible for a superannuation contribution on their share of the payment.

In most circumstances, your contribution will be paid to the fund your superannuation contributions are currently paid to.
