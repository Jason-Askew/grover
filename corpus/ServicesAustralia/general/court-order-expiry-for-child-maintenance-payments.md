# Court order expiry

Child maintenance orders will end at a specified time, or when a particular event occurs.

Under family law, a child maintenance order will end:

-   if the child dies
-   if a parent dies, unless the order expressly provides for it to continue after their death
-   if the child is adopted, marries or starts a de facto relationship
-   when the child turns 18, unless the order says that it will continue after that
-   when the child finishes secondary school, unless the order was made to help the child complete their tertiary education, in which case the order will cease when the child completes their tertiary degree
-   if the child no longer has a disability and the order is for a child aged over 18 and was made because the child had a physical or mental disability.

If you would like more information, you should speak to your legal provider.
