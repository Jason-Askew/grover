-   [Attend an appointment](#a1)
-   [Partner details](#a2)

Read about the [Status Resolution Support Service (SRSS) program](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/status-resolution-service/status-resolution-support-services) on the Department of Home Affairs website.

If the Department of Home Affairs accepts your application, you’ll need to attend an appointment with us to start getting your payment.

## Attend an appointment

Your service provider will help you arrange a new claim appointment with us.

At this appointment, we will ask for documents to prove things like your income and rent. We'll also enrol you in Medicare.

You’ll also need to prove your identity. You can prove your identity by showing us your ImmiCard or your passport.

## Partner details

During the claim, we may ask you to provide additional information about your partner. We may do this by asking you to complete the [Status Resolution Support Services Payment Partner details form](/su700).

### ImmiCard

Prove your identity by showing us your ImmiCard or ImmiCard Report, and either a:

-   Bridging Visa E grant letter
-   visa grant notification letter
-   Residence Determination letter.

### Passport

Prove your identity by showing us your current or expired passport. This must be the one that you arrived in Australia on with your valid Australian visa.

If you don’t have any of these documents to prove your identity, talk to your SRSS service provider.
