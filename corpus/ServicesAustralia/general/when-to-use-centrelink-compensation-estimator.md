# When to use the Centrelink compensation estimator

You can use the compensation estimator to help you understand how a preclusion period and charge amount may affect you.

You can get an estimate of what your preclusion period is before your compensation claim is settled. You can also get an estimate of the amount you’ll need to repay us from a compensation payment. The estimator is a guide only.

Don’t use the compensation estimator if either:

-   you have lump sums awarded by a court or tribunal after a contested hearing
-   it’s for a payment that’s only for weekly periodic payments.

Our compensation estimator can tell you all the following:

-   how compensation affects your payment
-   if you need to repay us
-   if your compensation will stop your payments and for how long.

Follow the estimator’s instructions. It will ask you to fill in details about your compensation claim.
