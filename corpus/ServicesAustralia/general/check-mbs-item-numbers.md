## Check items using HPOS

The MBS items online checker lets you:

-   view and check patient eligibility based on their MBS history
-   check your own eligibility for claiming or billing MBS items
-   check claiming conditions for MBS items.

It doesn’t let you check in-hospital items or a patient’s eligibility linked to a MyMedicare registration. This checker helps you make informed treatment decisions and avoid rejected claims.

You can access the checker in HPOS with a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account. If you don’t have one, you can [register for a PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

### Using the checker

To use the checker:

1.  Select **Items** in HPOS, and then **MBS items online checker**.
2.  Enter your **Patient’s Medicare details**.
3.  You need to **declare** you’ve received the patient’s consent to do the search.
4.  Select the **Provider number** and **Location** from the first dropdown boxes.
5.  Use **Search item number** to find a specific MBS item or **Filter by care plan** to filter the items by the Care plan type.
6.  Select which **MBS item number** you want to check, you’ll get a short description if you hover over an item number.
7.  Review your **Selected items** if you’re checking multiple MBS items.
8.  Select **Check items** to do the item check.

The search results will show the patient’s eligibility for each item you selected. It’ll also tell you if there are any conditions for your patient with the result.

Some MBS items have restrictions related to the provider number linked to your practice location.

If you’re checking a care plan item number, enter this individually so the result is accurate and doesn’t have conflicts.
