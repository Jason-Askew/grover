# Compensation and damages form (MOD C)

Use this form to let us know about compensation you’ve already received, you’re getting now, or you’re about to get.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Compensation and damages form](/sites/default/files/2024-01/modc-2402en-f.pdf "PDF document").

You don’t need to complete this form if you’re getting a payment from an Income Protection Policy attached to a Superannuation Fund. If you’re not sure about your payment, [call us](/phone-us) on your regular payment line to talk to us about it.

Remember to sign it before you submit it with your supporting documents.
