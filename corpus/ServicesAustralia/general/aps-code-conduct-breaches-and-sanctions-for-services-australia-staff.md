# APS Code of Conduct breaches and sanctions

Our procedures for determining if a current or former employee has breached the APS Code of Conduct.

We have an obligation under the _Public Service Act 1999_ (the PS Act) to establish procedures for determining if APS employees, or former employees, have breached the Code of Conduct. The procedures also determine how we impose sanctions.

These procedures started 1 February 2020 and are made publicly available in accordance with section 15(7) of the PS Act:
