We may send you a letter or a message to your myGov inbox if your bank account balances haven’t been updated for some time.

## When your bank account balance changes

You need to keep your bank account balances up to date so we can pay you the right amount.

You can update your bank account balances at any time.

## When your bank account opens or closes

You should also tell us if you closed or opened a bank account so we can pay you.
