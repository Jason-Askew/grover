# Enrol your baby in Medicare only

If you don’t wish to claim for a families payment, you’ll need to submit proof of birth to enrol your baby in Medicare.

To do this, complete the full Newborn Child Declaration form and return it to us. The form is in the Parent Pack from your hospital or midwife. This will:

-   enrol your baby in [Medicare](/medicare) and the [Medicare Safety Net](/medicare-safety-nets)
-   register your baby for a My Health Record
-   enrol your baby into the [Australian Immunisation Register](/australian-immunisation-register).

Only the birth mother can register a newborn child for My Health Record using the Newborn Child Declaration form. You can read more about [registering a child for a My Health Record](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/my-health-record/getting-started/access-or-create-a-childs-record) on the Australian Digital Health Agency website.

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to submit your completed form.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also submit the form either:

-   using the myGov app
-   at a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   by post, the instructions are on the form.

If you’re [becoming a parent through a surrogacy](/enrolling-your-baby-medicare-if-you-become-parent-through-surrogacy?context=60001), you can also enrol your baby in Medicare online or using the form.

If you lose your Newborn Child Declaration form, you need to submit a [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). You’ll need to give supporting documentation requested in the form, including proof of your child’s birth.

We’ll add your child to your Medicare card, and send an updated card once enrolment is complete.

If you become a parent through surrogacy

You can enrol your baby in Medicare when your surrogacy arrangement is finalised.
