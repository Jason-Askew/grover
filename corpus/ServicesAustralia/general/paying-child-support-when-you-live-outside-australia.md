We’ll try to contact you to discuss your payments and check your Australian assessment is correct and reflects your circumstances.

We’ll try to contact you if all of the following apply:

-   you have an Australian child support assessment
-   you owe a child or spousal maintenance debt
-   you’re a paying parent
-   you live in another country.

We’ll ask about your income and circumstances. We do this to make sure your Australian [child support assessment](/child-support-assessment) is correct.

## What to tell us

You need to tell us:

-   about your circumstances, including any other children you may be responsible for
-   your income in the currency you earned it in, this may not be in Australian dollars
-   what you earned in the financial year where you live, this may not be the same as the Australian financial year
-   about documents you have that prove your income.

We use average exchange rates to convert your income into Australian dollars.

We’ll also talk to you about making payments, including making a payment arrangement for any amounts you may owe.

If you don’t give us the information we need we may ask the maintenance authority in your country.

## How to tell us

You can tell us by:

-   filling in the [Income declaration - Income earned outside Australia form](/cs4145)
-   calling one of our [Child Support international lines](/phone-us#csinternational)
-   [writing to us](/write-to-us).

## If you don’t pay

If you don’t pay your child support, we may take action to enforce the collection of the amounts owing. Find out more about [overdue child support payments](/recovering-child-and-spousal-support-payments?context=21911).

If you live in a [reciprocating jurisdiction](/reciprocating-jurisdictions-and-residency-for-child-support?context=21911) we can refer your case to the maintenance authority in your country. Once the assessment is recognised, they will then take responsibility for collecting payments from you. They’ll use the full range of enforcement actions under their law.

### If we refer your case to the maintenance authority in your country

In most countries, the court system will need to recognise an Australian [child support assessment](/child-support-assessment). The maintenance authority or the court in your country will contact you about this process.

Once the court has recognised the assessment, the maintenance authority will notify you of how much to pay. This amount will be in the currency of the country you live.

You’ll need to make payments to the maintenance authority.

They collect all payments and send them to us.

We’ll then convert the amounts into Australian dollars and send the payments to the receiving parent. We pay the cost of converting the payments into Australian dollars.

Call one of our [Child Support international lines](/phone-us#csinternational) if you would like to discuss paying child support when you live outside Australia.

## If you live in New Zealand

We manage child support differently if you live in New Zealand.
