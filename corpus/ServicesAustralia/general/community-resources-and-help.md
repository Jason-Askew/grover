# Community resources and help

You can use these resources with people in your community to help them access our payments and services.

These resources include communication products such as posters, fact sheets and social media tiles. We recommend you return to this page often to make sure you use the current versions with your community.

We offer guidance and support in times of need. This includes:

-   help from our [specialist staff](/community-access?context=21#specialiststaff)
-   referrals to other services.

If a person is getting a payment from us, they may get:

-   extra [payments to help in a crisis](/crisis-and-other-help#howwecanhelp)
-   [advance payments](/advance-payment).

Everyone can:

-   talk to our [social workers](/social-work-services)
-   talk with a [Financial Information Service Officer](/financial-information-service)
-   get information to help [manage their money](/manage-your-money).

Our [Service Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/service-finder) can help people in your community find services in their area. Use [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what payments they might be eligible for.

We also offer help for those who:

-   are [homeless](/housing)

-   are affected by [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence)
-   need information to help them [manage their money](/manage-your-money).
