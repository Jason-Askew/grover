# Other payments

If you get another payment from us, you may also get the Assistance for Isolated Children payment.

You get Assistance for Isolated Children if you also get any of the following payments:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit)
-   [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance)
-   [Disability Support Pension](/disability-support-pension)
-   [Parenting Payment single](/parenting-payment)
-   [Double Orphan Pension](/double-orphan-pension).

You can't get Assistance for Isolated Children payments for a student who gets any of the following payments:

-   [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance)
-   [ABSTUDY](/abstudy)
-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs Veterans’ Children Education Scheme payments.

Some students turning 16 years of age may be eligible for assistance under the Away from Home rate of Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY instead of this scheme and Family Tax Benefit.

Families who get Assistance for Isolated Children and Family Tax Benefit generally get more from these payments compared to the Youth Allowance Away from Home rate and [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance).

Students getting Disability Support Pension or Parenting Payment if they’re single may get Assistance for Isolated Children Pensioner Education Supplement. This can occur if studying at either:

-   primary level
-   equivalent ungraded level.

Students studying at secondary or tertiary level should apply for either:

-   Pensioner Education Supplement
-   ABSTUDY Pensioner Education Supplement.

You can also check if your state or territory government provides additional benefits for isolated students.
