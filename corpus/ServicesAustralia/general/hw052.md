# Banking details online claiming form (HW052)

Use this form for adding or changing the payee provider's bank details.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

We may contact you for security reasons if you're adding or changing your bank details recorded with us.

It's quicker to update your bank details online through Health Professional Online Services (HPOS). You'll be able to check your changes within 24 hours. You don’t need to use a paper form.

You'll need a PRODA account to access HPOS.

Learn about [PRODA (Provider Digital Access)](/provider-digital-access-proda) and [Managing your banking details](/manage-your-details-hpos).

If you can’t use HPOS, download and complete the [Banking details online claiming form](/sites/default/files/hw052-2106en-f.pdf "PDF document").
