# Payments that show on it

Your payment summary shows most taxable and non-taxable payments you got from us in a tax year.

## on this page

-   [Taxable payments](#a1)
-   [Non-taxable payments](#a2)
-   [Tax year](#a3)

If you’re lodging a tax return, your payment summary details should pre-fill into your tax return by mid-July each year. Other income and information should pre-fill by late July. Family Tax Benefit is a non-taxable payment. If you only got payments of Family Tax Benefit from us you won’t get a payment summary and you don’t need to include it in your tax return.

## Taxable payments

-   person you get Carer Allowance for is of Age Pension age and you transferred from [Wife Pension](/rules-if-you-transferred-from-wife-pension-to-carer-payment).

## Non-taxable payments

If you only got Family Tax Benefit, you won’t get a payment summary and you don’t need to include this in your ATO tax return.

You must include the following non-taxable payments that show on your payment summary, in your tax return:

-   Carer Payment, if you and all care receivers are under Age Pension age
-   Disability Support Pension, if you are under Age Pension age
-   Youth Disability Supplement, when paid with Disability Support Pension
-   Remote Area Allowance.

## Tax year

A tax year or financial year is different to a calendar year.

A calendar year is from 1 January to 31 December. But a tax year is from 1 July one calendar year to 30 June the next calendar year. For example, 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. We refer to this as the 2024-25 tax year or financial year.

When you lodge a tax return, it’s for income you got in the last tax year.

### Example

Simmo started getting a taxable payment from us on 10 September 2024. They also did paid casual work at a café from 1 October 2024 to 15 March 2025. Simmo’s income and payment are within the 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 period.

Simmo will need to lodge a tax return to declare this income to the Australian Taxation Office. This means they’ll lodge a tax return for the 2024-25 tax year.

Simmo lodges their tax return in late July, after their Centrelink payment summary and café job details pre-fill in ATO myTax. Using pre-filled information helps Simmo avoid mistakes and the need to amend and re-submit their tax return.
