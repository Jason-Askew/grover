# When your baby arrives

Use your Parent Pack to help finalise your pre-birth claim, make a new claim and enrol your baby in Medicare.

Register the birth of your baby as soon as possible. If you don’t, we may not be able to pay you.

## Get your Parent Pack

You’ll get a Parent Pack from your hospital or midwife. It contains a Newborn Child Declaration. Make sure your doctor or midwife completes the Proof of Birth declaration on the back page.

If you have a Centrelink Customer Reference Number and Medicare card, include these numbers on the back page.

Keep in mind, this isn’t a claim form to get payments. We need the back page as proof of birth to finalise your pre-birth claim. We’ll also need this when you make a new claim for:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit), including [Newborn Upfront Payment and Newborn Supplement](/newborn-upfront-payment-and-newborn-supplement)
-   [Parental Leave Pay](/parental-leave-pay).

If you lose your Newborn Child Declaration, it can’t be reissued. You can still give us proof of birth with either:

-   a birth certificate or certified extract
-   another Australian Government document that verifies the child’s name and date of birth, such as a passport or naturalisation certificate.

You can also give us proof of birth with a letter from the doctor or midwife who attended the birth. This includes home births. The letter must include all of the following:

-   the parents' details
-   your child’s name, date and place of birth
-   the doctor or midwife’s signature, qualifications and registration number.
