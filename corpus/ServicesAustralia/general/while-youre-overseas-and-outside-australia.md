## Keep us up to date

It may be difficult to keep us up to date while you are overseas if you haven’t set up your online account. It’s important you do this before you go, so you can check your sign in options.

If you can’t access myGov while you’re away, you can’t update your details online.

## Setting up online accounts while you’re overseas

If you’re already overseas, you can create a myGov account. You can link your services including Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support. Find out more about [how to create a myGov account](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account) on the myGov website.

After you’ve set up your account, check your sign in options. If you choose your Digital ID or secret questions and answers to sign in, you won’t need your Australian mobile number. Find out more about [accessing myGov while overseas](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/help-using-your-account/accessing-mygov-while-overseas) on the myGov website.

You can get help creating and managing your myGov account in the help section of the myGov website. Find out more about how to contact myGov or your linked services in the [contact us](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/contact) section of the myGov website.

Once you have a myGov account, you can set up your myGov app. Then you can access the same account through the myGov app. Find out more about the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) on the myGov website.

### If you get a Centrelink payment or concession card

You must continue to meet the eligibility rules to keep your [payments or concession card while you’re outside Australia](/payments-while-outside-australia).

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can keep us up to date online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also update us by [calling us](/phone-us) on the phone number that relates to your payment.

### If you’re enrolled in Medicare

Medicare doesn’t cover you while you’re overseas. Make sure you have a [plan for health care](/health-care-planning-when-going-overseas?context=60040) before you travel. Countries that have a [Reciprocal Health Care Agreement](/reciprocal-health-care-agreements) with us may cover some of the cost.

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov you can update your details online.

### If you have a Child Support case

If your situation or circumstances change while overseas, you’ll need to keep us up to date.

If your Child Support online account is linked to myGov you can do this online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.csaonline.gov.au/csos_site/csos-base/basePage.jsf?wec-appid=cssr_app&wec-locale=en_US)

You can [choose how to pay child support](/choose-how-to-pay-child-support) while you are overseas. You can also call us on one of our [Child Support international lines](/phone-us#csinternational).

## Get help in an emergency

If you’re overseas and are impacted by an emergency, contact an Australian consulate. Find out more about [consular services](https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/consular-services/consular-services-charter) on the Smartraveller website.

Consulates can help if you:

-   need an emergency passport
-   have experienced a natural disaster, terrorist attack or civil disturbance
-   are a victim of a crime
-   have been arrested
-   need help with a death of an Australian.

## Prepare for returning home

What happens [when you come home](/when-youre-returning-to-australia-from-overseas?context=60040) depends on which state or territory you’re returning to. Make sure you’re aware of any changes while you’re away.
