# How to contact us

We have Financial Information Service (FIS) Officers to help you.

-   [Talk to us](#a1)
-   [Bring someone with you](#a2)

## Talk to us

If you get a payment from us, [call us](/phone-us) on the same number you use to call Centrelink. If you don’t get a payment from us, call us on the [Centrelink Older Australians](/phone-us#olderaustralians) line. When asked why you’re calling, say ‘Financial Information Service’.

Depending on your circumstances, the FIS Officer may book a face to face interview for you, either online through [video chat](/video-chat-appointments) or in person at a local service centre.

If you join our [free financial webinars](/financial-information-service-live-webinars?context=21836) live, you can also ask us questions during the event using the chat function.

## Bring someone with you

You can bring someone with you when you visit us.

You can also arrange for someone else to speak to us for you. You must [give them authority to do this](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support).

If you’re a member of a community group you may be able to have a FIS Officer visit to speak to your group.

If you need support for aged care matters our [Aged Care Specialist Offers](/aged-care-specialist-officer-my-aged-care-face-to-face-services) (ACSO) can help you. Read more about how you can talk to an ACSO in-person or via video chat.
