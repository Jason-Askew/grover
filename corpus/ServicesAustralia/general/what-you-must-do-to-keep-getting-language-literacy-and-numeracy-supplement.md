# What you must do

There are some things you must do to keep getting the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Supplement.

You must do both of these:

-   continue to be eligible for the income support payment you get
-   remain actively involved in the [Skills for Education and Employment program](https://www.dewr.gov.au/skills-education-and-employment), on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website.
