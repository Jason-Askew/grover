# Work Bonus

If you’re an eligible pensioner who is working, the Work Bonus can help you keep more of your pension.

The Work Bonus is a scheme that helps reduce the amount of your employment income that counts towards the income test for your pension. It’s an incentive for older Australians to participate in the workforce by offsetting some of your income.

This video explains what the Work Bonus is and how it works.
