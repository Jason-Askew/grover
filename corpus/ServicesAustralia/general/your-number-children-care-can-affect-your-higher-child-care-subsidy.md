If your family has more than one child aged 5 or younger in care, you may get a higher Child Care Subsidy (CCS) for one or more of your children.

Watch this video to learn more about a higher rate of CCS.

## Who can get a higher subsidy

You can get a higher subsidy for one or more of your children, if all of these apply:

-   you get or will be eligible for CCS
-   your family’s combined income is under $367,563
-   your family has more than one CCS eligible child aged 5, or younger.

If your family has more than one child aged 5 or under we’ll assess which children get a higher subsidy by working out both:

-   the ‘standard rate child’
-   the ‘higher rate child’ or the ‘higher rate children’.

The ‘standard rate child’ is usually your eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or under. This child will get the [standard CCS percentage.](/your-income-can-affect-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#familyincomeccs)

The ‘higher rate child’ is any CCS eligible child younger than your standard rate child. You’ll get a higher subsidy rate for them.

For children born on the same date, such as twins, we’ll automatically determine one child as the ‘standard rate child’. We’ll then apply a higher rate to other eligible children.

We won’t pay a higher subsidy for sessions of In Home Care (IHC). This is because IHC is subsidised for the family, rather than for each child. IHC will continue to be paid the standard CCS rate.

### How to check your CCS percentage

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can check your CCS percentage online.

To do this:

1.  Select **My family**.
2.  Under **Child care**, select **Child Care Subsidy summary**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

## How much you can get

The rates for each child are worked out separately.

The ‘standard rate child’ is usually your eldest CCS eligible child aged 5 or under. This child will get the standard CCS percentage.

The ‘higher rate child’ is any CCS eligible child younger than your standard rate child. You’ll get a higher subsidy rate for them.

Use the [Child Care Subsidy calculator](https://www.startingblocks.gov.au/child-care-subsidy-calculator) on the Starting Blocks website to see what you may be eligible for.

Higher CCS rates no longer apply, all children in the family will get the standard CCS rate

There are examples to help you understand [how your CCS is calculated](/examples-to-help-you-understand-your-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) based on your family situation.

### Combined families

Combined families are where both members of the couple get CCS for different children in their family.

Your combined family will be assessed as a whole for a higher rate of CCS. This includes all CCS eligible children aged 5 and under in your care and your partner’s care.

## What you need to do

We’ll automatically work out if you’re eligible. If you are, we’ll apply a higher subsidy to any eligible children in your family and start paying it to your child care service to reduce your fees.
