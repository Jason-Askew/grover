## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with somatrogon and somatropin under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 100 for paediatric patients with severe growth hormone deficiency.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing somatrogon and somatropin.

## Section 100 arrangements

### Somatrogon and somatropin

This item is PBS-subsidised under Section 100 and can be dispensed by a:

-   community pharmacy
-   participating PBS reform public hospital pharmacy
-   private hospital pharmacy
-   dispensing doctor.

## Treatment specifics

To be eligible for PBS-subsidised treatment with somatrogon or somatropin, patients must be treated by either a:

-   specialist or consultant physician in paediatric endocrinology, or by a specialist or consultant physician in general paediatrics in consultation with a nominated specialist or consultant physician in paediatric endocrinology
-   medical practitioner in consultation with a nominated specialist or consultant physician in paediatric endocrinology, or by a medical practitioner in consultation with a nominated specialist or consultant physician in general paediatrics.

You can write prescriptions for brand specific somatropin. This must be written on the prescription and include the form and strength. For computer generated prescriptions, you’ll need to put the active ingredient first, followed by the brand name, form and strength.

The same brand, including the form and strength, must be used for both the original and repeats. If you need to change brands during a patient’s treatment, you must apply for a new authority approval from Services Australia.
