# Your percentage of care may affect your payment

We consider each parent or non-parent carer’s care of the child as part of our child support assessment. This is their percentage of care.

## How we work out your care percentage

We usually work out your care percentage based on the amount of care you provide.

You and the other parent may be able to agree how much care you each provide. You might both tell us one parent has care for 56 nights a year, and the other has care for the rest of the time.

If you can’t agree, we’ll work it out for you.

We may ask for evidence such as:

-   a diary or calendar showing when you care for the children
-   a court order or [parenting plan](/parenting-plans-for-child-support-assessment?context=21911), with evidence that you’re doing what it says
-   documents that show the children are in day care, school or other regular activities
-   records of visits to health care or other services
-   airline bookings or passports showing travel dates
-   statements made by other people.

Evidence of statements made by other people can include voice recordings, text messages and social media posts. You can’t give us any verbal or written statements from anyone under 18.

We may work out your care percentage differently if you have a written care arrangement that isn’t being followed. If we do this, we base your care percentage on your written care arrangement for an interim period. Read more about [disputed care](/disputed-care-and-interim-periods?context=21911).

## What the levels of care are

There are 5 levels of care:

-   below regular care
-   regular care
-   shared care
-   primary care
-   more than primary care.

Your care percentage also affects how much Family Tax Benefit Part A you can get.

Read about [Child Support and Family Tax Benefit Part A](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=21911).

### Below regular care

This is care from 0% to less than 14% of the time. It means either:

-   0 to 51 nights a year
-   0 to less than 2 nights a fortnight.

A paying parent providing below regular care can’t get [Family Tax Benefit (FTB)](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=21911) or other family payments.

### Regular care

This is care from 14% to less than 35% of the time. It means either:

-   52 to 127 nights a year
-   2 to 4 nights a fortnight.

A paying parent who provides regular care will pay less child support.

A paying parent who provides regular care can’t get FTB payments, however they or their partner may be able to get [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy), [Rent Assistance](/rent-assistance) and a [Health Care Card](/health-care-card). They may also be able to get a higher rate of income support payment.

### Shared care

This is care from 35% to 65% of the time. It means either:

-   128 to 237 nights a year
-   5 to 9 nights a fortnight.

A paying parent who provides shared care will pay less child support.

Both parents may get family payments from us. They may be able to share [FTB](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=21911).

### Primary care

This is care from 65% to 86% of the time. It means either:

-   238 to 313 nights a year
-   10 to 12 nights a fortnight.

A parent who provides primary care doesn’t have to pay child support.

### More than primary care

This is care for more than 86% of the time.

A parent who provides more than primary care doesn’t have to pay child support.

If you provide more than primary care you can receive 100% of any [FTB](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=21911).

## If your care arrangements change

If the care arrangements for your child change it can affect your child support assessment. If the way you share care for your child changes, call the [Child support enquiries line](#toolbar-phone) as soon as you can. We may need to change your care percentage and child support payments.

The date your assessment is affected by the care change depends on whether:

-   your care has increased or decreased
-   you tell us within 28 days.

If you tell us within 28 days of your care arrangements changing, we are generally able to adjust your assessment from when the change occurred. This means we can apply the correct level of care to your assessment from that day.

If the change means neither parent or carer has at least 35% actual care, we will end your assessment.

### What happens if you tell us late

If you tell us or we’re notified about a care change more than 28 days after it occurred, we may apply your new level of care from different dates. This will depend on whether your care has increased or decreased. If your new level of care has increased, we will only apply the decision from the date we were told about the change. If your care has decreased, we’ll apply the change from when the change happened.

If the change means neither parent or carer has at least 35% care recorded in your assessment, we may suspend the assessment. This will be for the period between when the care arrangement changed and the day before you notify us.

### What happens if you tell us after 26 weeks

As long as a parent still has more than 35% care recorded in the assessment, we will apply the new level of care. This will be from either the date the care changed or the date we were notified. However, if you tell us more than 26 weeks after your care arrangements change, and there is less than 35% care recorded in the assessment for both parents, we will end your assessment.

### If you have a child support agreement

Child support won’t be paid to a parent under a child support agreement if they have less than 35% care. The child support agreement may end or suspend for the child if this occurs.

Read more about the effect of care changes on your [binding child support agreement](/binding-child-support-agreement) or [limited child support agreement](/limited-child-support-agreement).
