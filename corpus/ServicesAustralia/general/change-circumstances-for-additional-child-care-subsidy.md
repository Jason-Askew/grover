# Change of circumstances

You need to tell us if your circumstances change when you’re receiving Additional Child Care Subsidy.

If you don’t tell us about the changes within 14 days, your subsidy may be affected. We may overpay you and have a debt that you’ll need to pay back.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to tell us about changes to your circumstances.
