## Calling us for help

You can [contact us](/contact-us) if you have questions about:

-   Centrelink payments or debts
-   Medicare cards, payments or processes
-   Child Support assessments or debt.

If you’re affected by family and domestic violence, you can let us know. Anything you tell us is private. Any of our staff can help you get the right support.

If you’re separating from your partner, it’s important that you update your relationship status before changing your personal details. This will help [protect your personal information](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship?context=60033) so only you can see it.

Our social workers can also provide free, confidential counselling. They can refer you to other services that might help. To talk to a social worker, call us on the same number you usually use to call us and ask to speak with a social worker.

If you don’t usually call us, call the Employment Services line on 132 850. You’ll then need to ask to speak with a social worker.

Keep in mind, you may need to wait on hold before you speak to someone.
