## Existing business customers

Your business may already be in the PRODA registry. If it is, and you’re responsible for applying for a service in Business Hub, you’ll need to do one of the following:

-   join the business in PRODA. You can do this if you’re an associate or authorised contact on the ABR record and link to Business Hub
-   contact the person in your business who registered your business in PRODA.

Contact our [PRODA](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda) helpdesk if you need help.

If your business is not in the PRODA registry, follow the new business customer steps on this page to register.
