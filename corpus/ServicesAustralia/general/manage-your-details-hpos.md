# Manage your details

Manage your personal and professional details in Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

HPOS is a secure way for health professionals and organisations to do business with us online.

You must have a Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to access HPOS. You can access HPOS as an individual, or on behalf of an organisation. If you don’t have a PRODA account, [register for PRODA](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account) online. Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

You can also [manage your provider and prescriber numbers](/manage-your-provider-and-prescriber-numbers?context=20) using HPOS.

2.  Select the **Plus icon** button located on the right side of the screen, then select the **Edit** button to change your list.

Banking details

You can nominate bank account details for your current provider numbers in HPOS. The **My banking details** section in HPOS shows all your current provider numbers and the bank details registered against them.

Where there are bank details registered for different programs on one provider number, a separate line will display for each program against that provider number. For example, a provider works at a clinic under provider number 123456A. They have registered EFT details for Medicare and the Practice Incentive Program Service Incentive Payment (PIPSIP). HPOS will display 2 lines against 123456A. A line for Medicare and a line for the PIPSIP.

Programs you’re registered for but haven’t nominated banking details for won’t display on this list.

Changes will be visible in HPOS within 24 hours.

Follow these steps to add or update your bank account details:

1.  Log in to PRODA to use HPOS.
2.  Select **My personal details**.
3.  Select **My banking details**. A list of all provider numbers and programs with bank details registered will display.
4.  Select **Add** or **Update** against the provider numbers or programs.
5.  Enter the details or select an existing account from the drop down list and select the **Acknowledgement checkbox**.
6.  Select **Submit**. A success screen will display to confirm details have been updated.

If your Minor ID needs updating, call the [eBusiness Service Centre](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#ebusiness).

HPOS delegates no longer have access to manage their Provider’s banking details.
