# Residence rules

To be eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A and Part B you must meet the residence rules.

On the day you claim, you and your child must be [living in Australia](/residence-descriptions?context=22151#livinginaustralia).

You must also have one of the following:

-   Australian citizenship
-   a permanent visa
-   a [Special Category visa](/residence-descriptions?context=22151#scv)
-   a certain temporary visa, that is a [partner provisional](/residence-descriptions?context=22151#ppv) or [temporary protection type visa](/residence-descriptions?context=22151#tptv).

Your child must be living with you or have one of the following:

-   Australian citizenship
-   a permanent visa
-   a [Special Category visa](/residence-descriptions?context=22151#scv).

For this payment, living with you means you and your child normally live together at the same address.

You can also claim if you’re a subclass 403 visa holder who is part of the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme family accompaniment initiative.

To keep getting your payment, you both must continue to meet these residence rules.

## When you need to wait

If you’ve recently arrived as a resident in Australia, you may have to wait one year to get Family Tax Benefit Part A. There are [some exemptions to this](/exemptions-from-newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22151). Read more about the [newly arrived resident’s waiting period](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22151).

There is no waiting period for Family Tax Benefit Part B.
