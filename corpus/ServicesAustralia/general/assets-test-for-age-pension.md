# Assets test

The assets test helps us work out if you can get paid Age Pension. It also affects how much you'll get.

-   [What the limits are for a part pension](#a2)
-   [What the limits are for a transitional rate of pension](#a3)
-   [Where to find other help](#a4)

We assess all [asset types](/asset-types?context=22526) as part of the assets test. How much we can pay you depends on the value of your assets, your homeownership status and if you’re in a relationship. There are limits to how much you can have to get Age Pension. We call these the assets test limits. The Department of Social Services reviews these limits and cut off points in March, July and September each year.

Your [assets](/asset-types?context=22526) include any property or possessions you own in full, in part, or have an interest in. This includes both:

-   assets held outside Australia
-   debts owed to you.

## What the limits are for a full pension

When your assets are more than the limit for your situation, your pension will reduce.

If you’re a member of a couple, the limit is for both your and your partner’s assets combined, not each of you.

## What the limits are for a part pension

From 20 September 2025, part pensions cancel when your assets are over the cut off point for your situation.

If you’re a member of a couple, the limit is for both your and your partner’s assets combined, not each of you.

## What the limits are for a transitional rate of pension

From 20 September 2025, transitional rate pensions cancel when your assets are over your cut off point.

## Where to find other help

You can apply for [Asset Hardship provisions](/asset-hardship-provisions?context=22526) if you’re in severe financial hardship and your assets mean you either:

-   don’t get Age Pension
-   get a small amount of Age Pension.

Alternatively you may get help under the [Home Equity Access Scheme](/home-equity-access-scheme).

Asset types

Assets are property or items you or your partner own in full or part, or have an interest in. They can affect your payment.
