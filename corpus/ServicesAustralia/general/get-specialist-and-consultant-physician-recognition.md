# Get specialist and consultant physician recognition

Steps to bill or claim specialist or consultant physician items through Medicare.

Read more about [recognition rules for specialist and consultant physicians](/professional-recognition-information?context=20#accordion3).

Apply for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician

If you need recognition as a specialist or consultant physician, you can apply online using Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

You need a [Provider Digital Access (PRODA)](/provider-digital-access-proda) account to access [HPOS](/hpos?context=20). If you don’t have one, [register for PRODA online](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

You can apply for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician either:

-   when applying for your initial Medicare provider number
-   separately if you already have a Medicare provider number.

We’ll send you a HPOS message in your mailbox to let you know the outcome.

If you’re a fellow you need the following supporting documents:

-   a copy of your Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) registration
-   confirmation of your fellowship showing the specialty you’re applying for and date of approval as a specialist or consultant physician.

Evidence we accept includes:

-   your Australasian Specialist Medical College Fellowship certificate
-   a letter from the relevant Australasian Specialist Medical College confirming you’re a fellow.

If you don’t have Australasian fellowship, you need a copy of your Ahpra specialist registration that lists your specialty.

If your Ahpra registration doesn’t list your specialty, you also need to provide a letter from Ahpra confirming both of these:

-   you’re a registered specialist
-   the period your registration is valid.

If you can’t apply online, complete the [Application for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician form](/hw077?context=20).

Apply for recognition as a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) specialist

Recognition as a PET specialist allows you to bill and claim MBS items for PET services.

If you can’t apply online, complete the [Application for recognition as a specialist or consultant physician form (HW077)](/hw077?context=20).

Diagnostic radiology

To bill or claim MBS items for MRI services, you need to complete the [Application to register or amend a diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice form (HW061)](/hw061?context=20).

We’ll tell you if you can bill or claim MBS items for MRI services when we process your application.

Change in residency status

If you’re a temporary resident and become a permanent Australian resident you must tell us immediately. This is because you need to:

-   satisfy [Section 19AA of the Health Insurance Act 1973](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00255) by holding recognised postgraduate medical qualifications from the date your residency status changes or your **eligibility** for Medicare billing will stop
-   reapply for specialist or consultant physician recognition
-   apply for a 19AB exemption as a specialist or consultant physician.

If you don’t tell us about your change in residency status, it may mean you get money you’re not entitled to. You may get a debt you need to pay back.

You’ll need to provide copies of documents confirming your new residency status and the date it changed.

Bill or claim MBS items for MRI services (diagnostic radiology)

To bill or claim MBS items for MRI services, you need to complete the [Application to register or amend a diagnostic imaging or radiation oncology practice form (HW061)](/hw061?context=20).

We’ll tell you if you can bill or claim MBS items for MRI services when we process your application.

Bill or claim MBS items for sleep apnoea (sleep medicine)

To bill or claim MBS items for sleep apnoea, you need to provide advice from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians that you have either:

-   obtained equivalent to Level I of the advanced training program in either adult or paediatric sleep medicine
-   post-fellowship specialist recognition in sleep medicine.

You don’t need to pay an application fee to have this specialist recognition added to your provider record.

Remove recognition

You can write to us to tell us to stop recognising you for Medicare purposes. This can be an email or a letter and must include your:

-   provider number
-   full name
-   date of birth.

You must send the request yourself. No one can send it on your behalf.
