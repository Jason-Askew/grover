# Keep track of your PBS medicines

Keep track of your PBS medicines so you know when you’ve reached the PBS Safety Net threshold.

You need to keep a record of how much you’ve spent on PBS medicines during the year. That way, you’ll know when you’ve reached the [PBS Safety Net Threshold](/pbs-safety-net-thresholds?context=22016).

You can use the [PBS/RPBS Safety Net prescription record form and application for a Safety Net card form](/pb240).

Type your details on Page 1 of the form, then print out both pages. Each time you collect PBS medicine, hand both pages to the pharmacist. They will then record how much you’ve spent on PBS medicines.

Ask each pharmacy you use for a print out of what you’ve spent on PBS medicines. This will help you to keep a record for the PBS Safety Net.

If you always use the same pharmacy, you can ask them to keep a computer record for you. They can then tell you when you’re near the threshold.
