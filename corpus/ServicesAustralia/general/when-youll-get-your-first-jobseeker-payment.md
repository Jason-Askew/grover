## Why you may have to wait

Some people will have a one week [ordinary waiting period](/ordinary-waiting-period?context=51411). In some circumstances, you may have to wait for your first payment.

### You have savings or other money

If you or your partner have liquid assets over certain limits, you may have to wait 1 to 13 weeks. Liquid assets are any funds readily available to you or your partner. This includes money owed by your or your partner’s employer. Read about [liquid assets waiting periods](/liquid-assets-waiting-period?context=51411).

### You got a lump sum payment when you finished work

If your employer paid you a lump sum as either:

-   annual leave
-   a redundancy when you left.

The time you have to wait is relative to the lump sum payment. Read about [income maintenance periods](/income-maintenance-period?context=51411).

### You recently finished seasonal work

If you or your partner finished seasonal, contract or intermittent work in the 6 months before claiming. The time you need to wait depends on how much you earned and how long you were working. Read about the [seasonal work preclusion period](/seasonal-work-preclusion-period?context=51411).

### You’re new to Australia

If you’ve recently arrived in Australia as a resident, you may have to wait up to 4 years to qualify. Read about the [newly arrived resident’s waiting period](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=51411).

### You’ve had a compensation payment
