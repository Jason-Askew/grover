# Link your healthcare identifiers to HPOS

Link your healthcare identifiers to your Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account so you can access Health Professionals Online System (HPOS) functions.

You need an individual Provider Digital Access (PRODA) account to access Health Professionals Online System (HPOS). If you don’t have one, you can [register for an individual PRODA account](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to link your identifiers so that you can use HPOS.

We use identifiers to understand your role and give you access to the right functions in HPOS. Read which [identifier types you can link to access HPOS functions](/link-your-healthcare-identifiers-to-hpos?context=20).

If you don’t have an identifier, you can still use basic HPOS functions and [manage delegations](/manage-delegations-hpos?context=20).

Link your healthcare identifiers to PRODA

To link your identifiers to your PRODA account:

1.  Log in to your PRODA account.
2.  Select **HPOS** from the available services.
3.  Select **Yes** to the question **Have you been issued with any number or identifiers as part of your role?**
4.  Enter your **Ahpra number** or choose and enter another identifier type, then select **Search**.

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)

The service will check that your identifier record matches your PRODA details. You’ll then get access to the HPOS functions relevant to your identifier type.

The functions will be available to you straight away. They'll appear automatically under your HPOS service.

Link additional identifiers to access more HPOS functions

If you have multiple identifiers or identifier types, make sure you link them all. Then you'll be able to access all the HPOS functions you need.

To add additional identifiers:

1.  Log in to your PRODA account.
2.  Select **Link identifiers** on the HPOS tile.
3.  Follow the prompts to link your identifiers.

[Log in to PRODA](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au:5447/sso/sps/oidc/rp/HPOSWEB/kickoff/proda1)

The HPOS functions will appear when you select the **Go to service** option on the HPOS tile.

Identifiers you can link

You need to link at least one health care identifier to access HPOS functions.

If you’re a health care provider you need to link at least one of these identifiers to access HPOS functions:

-   Ahpra number.
-   Medicare provider number.
-   Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) provider number or Stem (individual).
-   Healthcare Provider Identifier-Individual (HPI-I) number.
-   Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Approved prescriber number.

If you’re an administrator registered in the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service, you can use one of these identifiers:

-   Responsible officer number.
-   Organisation maintenance officer number.
-   Healthcare Provider Identifier-Organisation (HPI-O) number.

If you don’t have an identifier you can still:

-   use basic HPOS functions
-   access Practice Incentives Program (PIP) or Workforce Incentives Program (WIP) - Practice Stream functions
-   access delegations.

If the linking service can’t match your identifier

What to do if the PRODA linking service can’t match your health care identifier when you try to link to HPOS.

If your identifier doesn’t match when you search for it, we can link it for you but we’ll need more details from you.

In the PRODA linking service:

1.  Select **Request help finding this number from a service officer**.
2.  Enter the details of the identifier that don't match.
3.  Select **Submit**.

Our staff will review this and link your service manually.

We’ll contact you, using your PRODA contact details, if we need more information.

The additional HPOS functions will appear when you select the Go to service option on the HPOS tile.
