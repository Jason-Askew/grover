# Change of circumstances

You must tell us if any of your circumstances change when you have a loan under the Home Equity Access Scheme.

## on this page

-   [What to tell us](#a1)
-   [How to tell us](#tellus)

If your circumstances change, tell us about it within 14 days in case it impacts your loan. If you don’t, we may pay you too much or your loan payments may stop.

## What to tell us

You must tell us if any of these things happen:

-   you [change or correct your name](/change-circumstances-for-loans-under-home-equity-access-scheme?context=22546#changename)
-   you or any co-owner of the secured real estate become bankrupt or subject to a personal insolvency agreement
-   you want to change the title details or dispose of any secured real estate
-   you take out, or change the details of, a mortgage on any secured real estate
-   you want to use the secured real estate to guarantee a loan taken by yourself or another person
-   you want to use a different property to the one you currently have secured to your loan
-   you want to add an additional property to your loan
-   the insured value of the property falls below the market value of all buildings on the property
-   your insurance ends, or you have changed insurance providers
-   you close, change or can no longer use the account we make your payments to
-   you want to settle your loan in full and release the charge or caveat from any secured real estate.

You must also tell us if any of the following happen:

-   you change your contact details or your residential or postal address
-   you leave the country, temporarily or to live somewhere else
-   you are in custody, on remand because you are in prison or charged with an offence
-   your partner dies.

You must also tell us within 14 days if you become partnered or separate from your partner. You can do this using one of the following forms:

-   [Partner details - if you live in Australia form](/mod-p) (MOD P)
-   [Separation details form](/mod-s) (MOD S).

If you don’t tell us about changes on purpose, you could be committing fraud. This could mean that the [no negative equity guarantee](/repay-your-loan-under-home-equity-access-scheme?context=22546#nonegativeequityguarantee) won’t apply when you settle the loan. Read about [how to avoid committing fraud](/avoid-committing-fraud?context=22546).
