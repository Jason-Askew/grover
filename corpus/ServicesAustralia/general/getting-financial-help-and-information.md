## Help from us

If you’re going through a hard time financially, you may want to get counselling, help and emotional support. Find out about our [social worker services](/social-work-services).

You can talk to one of our [Financial Information Service](/financial-information-service) (FIS) Officers for free. Our FIS Officers can share tools, resources and information that can help you make more informed financial decisions.

You can also find out more about how to [manage your money](/manage-your-money?context=60271).

If you already get an income support payment or Family Tax Benefit, you may be able to get an [advance lump sum payment](/advance-payment). An advance lump sum payment is like a loan from your Centrelink payment. You get some of your payment early as a lump sum amount. You then pay that back by getting a bit less in your next 13 payments.

If you’re experiencing financial abuse by someone limiting your access to money, find out [how we can help you with family and domestic violence concerns](/how-we-can-help-you-with-family-and-domestic-violence-concerns). Any behaviour that’s violent, threatening, controlling or intended to make you or your family feel scared and unsafe can be considered family and domestic violence.

You can avoid getting a Centrelink debt by keeping us up to date. You can find more information on when and how to notify Centrelink when you have a [change of circumstances if you get a Centrelink payment](/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment). If you owe us money, there are options to help you repay a [Centrelink debt](/centrelink-debts-and-overpayments?context=60271).

If you pay or receive child support payments, avoid a debt or overpayment by telling us as soon your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-for-child-support?context=21911). Update your details online or call us on the [Child Support Enquiry Line](/contact-child-support) and we’ll explain your options.

## Help with debt

If you’re dealing with debt there’s different ways to manage it. You can speak to your service providers to arrange payment plans or speak to a financial counsellor.

Financial counsellors can suggest ways to improve your financial situation, manage debt and access other support services. Find out how to contact a financial counsellor to suit your situation below.

If you need an interpreter to access these services, call the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) line on 131 450 and ask them to connect you.

If you get a payment from us and you’ve [overdrawn your bank account](/overdrawn-bank-account), talk to your financial provider. They may apply the [Code of Operation](/code-operation) to protect some of your Centrelink payment.
