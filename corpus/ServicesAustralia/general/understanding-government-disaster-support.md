# Understanding government disaster support

The Australian Government and state and territory governments work together to provide support if you’re affected by an eligible natural disaster event.

This arrangement is called Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA).

As part of DRFA, the Australian Government may fund up to 75% of the assistance available to individuals and communities. The state or territory government decides the areas that get assistance and the type of assistance available. You can apply for this assistance directly from your state or territory government.

Sometimes a disaster has a more significant impact on people and additional assistance is needed. During major disasters, the Australian Government may provide the following financial supports:

-   Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP)
-   Disaster Recovery Allowance (DRA).

AGDRP is a lump sum payment to help you when you’re directly affected by a declared disaster. If eligible, it is $1,000 per adult and $400 per child you care for younger than 16. Its purpose is to help you if:

-   the disaster caused major damage to your home, or a major asset or assets that you own at your home
-   you were seriously injured
-   you’re the immediate family member of an Australian citizen or resident who died or is missing.

DRA is a short term payment to help you if you lose income because of a declared disaster. It is available if you’re 16 years or older. DRA is paid fortnightly for up to 13 weeks from the date you started losing income.

If eligible, you’ll get the maximum equivalent rate of [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment) or [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance), depending on your personal circumstances

To get AGDRP or DRA, you must be an Australian resident or meet other [residence rules](/residence-rules-for-natural-disaster-support?context=60042).

Financial support is also available to eligible New Zealand citizens living in Australia.
