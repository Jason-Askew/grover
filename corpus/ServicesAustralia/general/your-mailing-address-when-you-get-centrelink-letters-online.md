# Your mailing address

You should make sure your mailing address is up to date, even if you get Centrelink letters online.

You might get letters in the post from us if:

-   you need to fill out a form and send it back to us
-   a service officer is writing to you
-   we include a brochure or attachment that’s not available online.

We may send a copy of the letter to your myGov Inbox as well.

## Why it’s important

It’s important we have a current mailing address. If you’re in the process of moving and you’re in-between home addresses, we want to keep your information safe.

You can tell us about a home address you are moving to in the future but we can only send your mail there from the date you’ve told us you’ll be living there. However, while you’re waiting for this to happen, it’s important you give us a secure mailing address. If you don’t, your mail will go to the last mailing address you gave us.

We have information and support available if you’re moving because of [changes to your relationship](/relationship-changes).
