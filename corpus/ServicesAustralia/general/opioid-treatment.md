## Patient eligibility

The PBS subsidises treatment for the management of severe pain with opioids. This is under the _National Health Act 1953_.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](http://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing opioid medications. Opioid items are listed separately on both the section 85 General Schedule and the Palliative Care Schedule. Restrictions can differ across listings.

Applications for increased quantities or repeats that are submitted in writing must state whether the request is for an item listed on the general schedule or the palliative care schedule. If the application is submitted with an authority application form, the correct form must be used according to the schedule on which the prescribed item is listed.

## Authority applications

### Applying for up to one month's treatment

Applications for authority approval to prescribe quantities and repeats sufficient for up to one month's treatment can be made either:

-   in real time using the [Online PBS Authorities System](/apply-for-pbs-authority?context=20)
-   by calling the [PBS authority approvals](/health-professionals-contact-information?context=20#pbsauthority) line.

### Applying for up to 3 month's treatment

Applications for authority approval to prescribe increased quantities and repeats sufficient for up to 3 months can be made either:

-   in real time using the [Online PBS Authorities System](/apply-for-pbs-authority?context=20)
-   in writing and either upload through [HPOS](/hpos?context=20) or post it to the address on the form.

Telephone authority requests for treatment beyond one month will not be approved.

All applications must include sufficient information to determine patient eligibility according to the restriction criteria. This information can be provided either on the authority prescription form or forms, or by completing the relevant authority application form.

When choosing to use the PBS Authority Application Forms:

-   if the item is listed on the Palliative Care Schedule, you should use the [Palliative Care Schedule - opioid treatment authority application form (PB306)](/pb306?context=20)
-   if the item is listed on the section 85 General Schedule, you should use the [General (S85) Schedule - opioid treatment authority application form (PB294)](/pb294?context=20).
