# Caring for a child with disability

If you care for a child with disability, there’s support and payments available to help you.

## Payments you can get

In addition to [Carer Payment](/carer-payment) and [Carer Allowance](/carer-allowance), there’s other support available if you care for a child with disability.

The [Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme](/assistance-for-isolated-children-scheme) can help you if your child can’t attend their local government school. This may be due to disability, special needs or because they’re in an isolated area.

[Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) is a 2-part payment that helps with the cost of raising children.

[Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) provides assistance to help you with the costs of child care.

Once your child turns 16 they may be able to get their own income support payment. Read more about [caring for a child with disability as they get older](/caring-for-child-with-disability-they-get-older?context=60097).

### If you already get a payment

[Carer Supplement](/carer-supplement) is an annual payment. It helps cover costs when caring for someone with disability or a medical condition. You’ll automatically get Carer Supplement if you get an eligible payment for caring for a period that includes 1 July.

[Child Disability Assistance Payment](/child-disability-assistance-payment) is an annual payment if you get Carer Allowance. You’ll get this payment automatically if both of the following apply, you:

-   got Carer Allowance for a period that includes 1 July
-   provided care for a child with disability or a severe medical condition.

[Carer Adjustment Payment](/carer-adjustment-payment) is a one-off payment for carers of a child younger than 7. It helps with children with a medical condition or major disability following a catastrophic event. You’ll need to show a strong need for financial help when you claim this payment.

If you get Carer Payment or Carer Allowance your child will get a [Health Care Card](/health-care-card). This concession card can help with the cost of health care.

You can [call us](/phone-us) on your payment line and ask us for an exemption for your mutual obligation requirements. This will depend on your caring responsibilities and can include caring for a child with disability or a medical condition. This applies if you get:

-   [JobSeeker Payment](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-jobseeker-payment)
-   [Parenting Payment](/change-circumstances-while-getting-parenting-payment?context=22196)
-   [Youth Allowance for job seekers](/change-circumstances-while-getting-youth-allowance-for-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43921)
-   [Special Benefit](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-special-benefit).
