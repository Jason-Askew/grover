Help for people directly affected by a natural disaster in Tasmania, such as fires, storms or floods.

We provide Australian Government assistance such as Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery Allowance when there’s a declared natural disaster event.

Your state government provides assistance which may include grants and loans.

You may be eligible for both Australian Government and state government natural disaster support.

## Australian Government support

There are no current events in TAS eligible for Australian Government support.

## Tasmanian Government support

The Tasmanian Government provides support for people affected by a natural disaster.

This may include:

-   individual and business grants
-   loans for small businesses and non-profit organisations
-   help from a Community Recovery Officer.

Check what emergencies and natural disaster assistance you can get on the [TasALERT website](https://alert.tas.gov.au/recovery/).

The Australian Government and state and territory governments work together to provide support if you’re affected by an eligible natural disaster event. Read more about [how government disaster support works](/understanding-government-disaster-support?context=60042).

## Other support

If you’ve been affected by a disaster, there may be other payments or support services to help you. Read about other support and [additional help for natural disasters](/additional-help-for-natural-disasters?context=60042).
