# How to manage your payment

If you get Child Care Subsidy (CCS), we need accurate information about your circumstances. You must keep your information up to date.

You can do this by regularly checking your details are correct.

You need to tell us if any of the following change:

-   your [family’s income](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=41186)
-   your or your partner’s [recognised participation](/update-your-recognised-participation-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186)
-   your [relationship status](/update-your-relationship-status-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186)
-   any other changes to you or your partner’s circumstances.

It’s important to keep your details update to date and let us know as soon as possible if there are changes. We may overpay you if we don’t have accurate and up to date details. If this happens, you’ll have to pay back the amount you owe. You could also miss out on payments if we don’t have up to date details.

You don’t need to let us know if you increase your days with the same child care service, or you change the days you use..

You can check and update your details anytime online. If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in to manage your Child Care Subsidy details.

If you get both Child Care Subsidy and Family Tax Benefit

We pay both the subsidy and Family Tax Benefit (FTB) based on your family income estimate. The higher your estimate is, the less subsidy and FTB you’ll get.
