# How to manage your payment

Your options and obligations for Farm Household Allowance (FHA).

There are things you need to do and tell us about while you’re getting FHA:

-   give us a new [estimate of your farm and farm related income](/estimating-business-income-for-farm-household-allowance?context=22161) if this changes
-   tell us about any [changes to your circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-farm-household-allowance?context=22161) within 14 days.

We also have tips for how to [manage your money](/manage-your-money).
