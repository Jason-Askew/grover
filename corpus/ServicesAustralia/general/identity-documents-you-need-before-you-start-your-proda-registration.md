# Identity documents you need before you start

We need to verify your identity online to complete the PRODA registration process.

To do this, you’ll need to enter details from three accepted and valid Australian Government issued identity documents. We won’t collect or store your documents for this.

You can’t use the same document twice or create an account for someone else using their identity documents.

You can use two of the following documents:

-   Medicare card
-   Australian driver’s licence
-   ImmiCard
-   Australian passport.

You can use one of the following documents:

-   Australian passport
-   Australian birth certificate
-   ImmiCard
-   Australian Citizenship certificate
-   Australian Visa (supported by a foreign passport)
-   Certificate of registration by descent.

You’ll need to provide one change of name document if the name on an identity document is different to the name:

-   the account was created in
-   on any other identity document.

PRODA will prompt you to verify one of the following listed official change of name documents in order to link the different names:

-   marriage certificate
-   change of name certificate.

## If you can’t verify your identity online

If you can’t confirm your identity online, you can use the [Manual Identity Verification Provider Digital Access form](/hw080). A greater range of documents are available using the form.

We won’t accept the following documents:

-   extracts
-   ceremonial or commemorative certificates
-   expired or illegible documents
-   copies of a digital credential.

If you don’t have the required documents, you can contact the agency or registrar that issued them to get what you need.

For more help or information, you can contact the [PRODA helpdesk](/business-and-employer-contact-information#proda).
