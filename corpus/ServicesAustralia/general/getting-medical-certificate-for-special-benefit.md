# Getting a medical certificate

If you get Special Benefit and can’t work or study for a short time you may need to give us a medical certificate.

## on this page

-   [Why you need to give us a medical certificate](#a1)
-   [What information you need to give us](#a2)
-   [Who can complete a medical certificate](#a3)
-   [When to give us a medical certificate](#a4)
-   [How to give us your medical certificate](#a5)

This applies if you’re getting Special Benefit and you have [mutual obligation requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=22281).

## Why you need to give us a medical certificate

If you’re sick or injured, you may get a temporary incapacity exemption from your requirements. You’ll need to give us a medical certificate so we can work out if we’ll either:

-   give you an exemption
-   reduce or change your requirements.

Call us on the [Centrelink Employment Services line](#toolbar-phone) to let us know. We may ask for a medical certificate after 14 days if you still need to isolate.

## What information you need to give us

Your medical certificate must include all of the following information:

-   what the sickness, injury or disability is
-   how long it will take for you to recover
-   the period you’ll be unable to work, participate or study.

It also needs to tell us if you’re unable to meet your requirements for at least 8 hours per week.

### Types of medical certificates

There are 2 types of medical certificates you can give us, either a:

-   Centrelink Medical Certificate form
-   non-Centrelink medical certificate.

The preferred evidence is a Centrelink medical certificate form. This helps us assess your exemption request faster. You can get a Centrelink Medical Certificate from your doctor.

## Who can complete a medical certificate

Only medical doctors may complete and sign the Centrelink Medical Certificate form. A medical doctor is a person with recognised medical qualifications, such as a general practitioner, physician or surgeon. If you live in a rural or remote area without a doctor, a community nurse can complete your medical certificate.

### Centrelink Medical Certificate form

Your doctor can either:

-   fill the Centrelink Medical Certificate form online, or print it and complete it by hand
-   give us a Centrelink Medical Certificate online using [Health Professional Online Services](/hpos).

### Non-Centrelink Medical Certificate

Your doctor may choose to use their own form. We’ll accept it as long as it has the required details and your doctor signs it.

## When to give us a medical certificate

You can do this if you’re sick or injured and you’re either:

-   making a new claim for Special Benefit
-   already getting Special Benefit and you have [mutual obligations requirements](/mutual-obligation-requirements?context=22281).

### Applying for an exemption when you claim Special Benefit

If you’re applying for an exemption when you claim, you’ll need to let us know if either of these apply:

-   you’re still doing paid work or study but you’re doing less hours because of your sickness or injury
-   you’re unable to look for work because of your sickness or injury.

You can submit your medical certificate as one of your supporting documents. Read about [how to submit your documents](/supporting-documents-for-special-benefit?context=22281).

### Applying for an exemption if you’re already getting a Special Benefit

You can apply for an exemption at any time. Your medical certificate will help us decide if your sickness or injury affects your ability to either:

-   do any suitable work
-   participate in other activities such as online training.

What happens when you give us a medical certificate

We use your medical certificate to work out if you need an exemption from your mutual obligation requirements for a short time. This is so you can keep getting Special Benefit.
