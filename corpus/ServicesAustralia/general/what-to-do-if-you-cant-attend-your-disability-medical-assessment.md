# What to do if you can’t attend your assessment

If you can’t attend your assessment, you can reschedule your appointment.

You must tell Sonic HealthPlus no later than 24 hours before the assessment if you can’t attend your appointment. You must call the Sonic HealthPlus Disability Medical Assessment Contact Centre on 1300 295 822 or +618 9329 5550 if you’re calling from outside Australia.

They’re open from 8 am to 6 pm (AEST) Monday to Friday.

## If you don’t attend your assessment

If you’re claiming Disability Support Pension (DSP) and you don’t attend, we may reject your claim.

If you’re already getting DSP, we may stop or cancel your DSP until you attend.
