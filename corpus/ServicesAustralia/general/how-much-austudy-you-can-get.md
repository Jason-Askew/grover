# How much you can get

The amount of Austudy you get depends on how much you earn.

## on this page

-   [Basic rates](#basicrates)
-   [Other rates](#otherrates)

We use an [income test](/income-tests-for-austudy?context=22441) and an [assets test](/assets-test-for-allowances?context=22441) to work out how much you can get.

Austudy is a taxable Centrelink payment. Read about [paying tax on your payment](/paying-tax-centrelink-payment?context=22441).

### When you’ve been on long term income support

As a student, you need to meet all the following to get the long term income support rate:

-   not have a dependent child
-   have a full time or concessional study load
-   get an income support payment that isn’t a student or apprentice payment
-   have been getting this other payment for at least 26 of the last 39 weeks before starting your course of study
-   begin your course after you turn 21.

As an Australian Apprentice you need to meet all the following to get this rate:

-   not have a dependent child
-   get an income support payment that isn’t a student or apprentice payment
-   have been getting this other payment for at least 26 of the last 39 weeks before starting your apprenticeship
-   begin your apprenticeship after you turn 21.

If you change your course or apprenticeship, you’ll keep getting this rate if both of the following apply:

-   you don’t have a break in qualifying study or apprenticeship
-   you continue to meet progress and [allowable time rules](/allowable-time-for-austudy?context=22441).

We don’t consider it a break in qualifying study if you complete semester 1 in one course and continue studies in a new course in semester 2.

If you change from one apprenticeship to another and your commonwealth registration number remains current, this is also not a break.

### When you’re studying an English language course

The different rates for Austudy may also apply if you meet all the following:

-   you don’t have a dependent child
-   English is not your first language
-   you’re studying an English language course.

If you have a dependent child, please check the basic rates that apply to your situation.
