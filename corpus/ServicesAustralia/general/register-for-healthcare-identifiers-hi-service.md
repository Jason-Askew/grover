# Register for Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service

A national system that uses identifiers for individuals and health care providers.

The Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service lets you access unique patient healthcare identifiers so you can include them in health records or patient files.

Healthcare identifiers allow you to match the correct record to the person you’re treating. This improves accuracy when you share health information with other health care providers.

To be eligible for a healthcare identifier or HI Service registration number, you must be one of the following:

-   a health care provider organisation
-   a supporting organisation
-   an individual health care provider.

Patients can also get an [Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI)](/individual-healthcare-identifiers).

Individual health care providers

Information for health care providers on how to register, set up access and use the HI Service.

If you’re a health care provider, you need to register to use the HI Service before you can:

-   get healthcare identifiers for patients, organisations and health care providers
-   make referrals and send secure messages to provider organisations or health care providers
-   view and upload information to patients’ My Health Records.

Health care providers include general practitioners (GPs), allied health professionals, nurses, dentists and pharmacists who provide patient care.

Once you’re registered, you need to [set up your access](/set-up-healthcare-identifiers-for-your-organisation?context=20) to HI Service and My Health Record.

It’s also important to [update your details](/update-your-health-care-provider-organisation-details-healthcare-identifiers-service?context=20) in the HI Service if they change.

Health care provider organisations

Information for health care provider organisations on how to register, set up access and use the HI Service.

If your organisation provides health care services, you need to register it to use the HI Service before you can:

-   view healthcare identifiers for patients, organisations and health care providers
-   make referrals and send secure messages to organisations or health care providers
-   view and upload information to patients’ My Health Records.

When you register your organisation in the HI Service, you’ll be assigned roles as both:

-   a responsible officer (RO)
-   an organisation maintenance officer (OMO).

Find out more about [roles in the HI Service](/roles-healthcare-identifiers-service?context=20).

Once you’ve registered, you need to [set up your organisation’s access](/set-up-healthcare-identifiers-for-your-organisation?context=20) to the HI Service and the My Health Record.

It’s also important to [update your health care provider organisation details in the HI Service](/update-your-health-care-provider-organisation-details-healthcare-identifiers-service?context=20) if they change.
