When we do reviews, we check the information you’ve given us is correct. It’s an opportunity for you to confirm or update your information. This means we can pay you the right amount and helps you avoid being overpaid.

## Bank interest reviews

We check if the bank account details you told us are correct. We need to check we paid you the right payment and amount in the past.
