# Issue and claim for PBS Safety Net cards

You can claim a payment for issuing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Safety Net cards to your patients.

To claim a payment for issuing PBS Safety Net cards, complete and submit the [PBS Safety Net claim for payment form (PB241)](/pb241?context=20) and send it to us within one month. You can use a PBS Safety Net reply paid envelope.

Read more about [PBS Safety Net stationery](/stationery?context=20) to order envelopes.

Issuing a PBS Safety Net card

When issuing a PBS Safety Net card, check all family details with your patient. This includes:

-   adding eligible family members who aren’t listed on the Prescription Record Form (PRF)
-   removing any family members who are no longer eligible or who were deceased before the start of the year
-   checking all relationship codes have been included and are correct
-   checking dependents aged 16-24, as at 1 January, are full time dependent students only.

For a family to be eligible for the PBS Safety Net Entitlement card, one or both parents must have a concession at some time during the calendar year.

PBS patient refunds shouldn’t be submitted as part of a PBS Safety Net claim. It may delay the processing of the refund.

Submitting a claim

When you submit your claim, you need to do all of the following:

-   record the correct values and calculate the total
-   sign your pharmacy’s Prescription Record Form (PRF) pharmacist declaration, as this is a legal requirement
-   check that the PRF has been signed by your patient or their agent
-   confirm the agent is anyone authorised by your patient to make the declaration on their behalf, noting it can’t be the issuing pharmacist or an employee of the issuing pharmacy
-   note there are no signature exemptions in place
-   check that each supply of medicine recorded has been signed by the supplying pharmacist
-   check the pages in each patient’s PRF are in sequential order
-   attach all PRFs in the order they appear on the claim form.

We’ll reject any incomplete PBS Safety Net claim forms and you’ll need to re-submit them.

The PBS Safety Net reply paid envelopes are for PBS Safety Net claims only. You can only submit one claim with up to 12 applications in each envelope.
