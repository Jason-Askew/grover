# What happens if your payment summary changes

If there’s a change to your payment summary details, we’ll send you a letter to let you know. The letter will tell you what payment summary detail changed and the tax year it’s for.

## on this page

-   [If you haven’t lodged your tax return](#a1)
-   [If you have lodged your tax return](#a2)

If you get your Centrelink letters online, we’ll send it to your [myGov](https://my.gov.au/) Inbox. If you don’t, we’ll post it to you. Please make sure your address details are up to date.

If the changes in the letter from us don’t show in ATO myTax, please [contact the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us) through their website.

## If you haven’t lodged your tax return

If you use ATO myTax, any change to your payment summary for the last tax year will update your pre-filled information.

When you do lodge your tax return, check the pre-fill details in ATO myTax match the details in the letter from us. If it matches, lodge your tax return as normal. If it doesn’t match, you can either:

-   change it yourself to match the details in the letter and then lodge it
-   [contact the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us) through their website.

## If you have lodged your tax return

If you’ve already done your tax return, you’ll need to amend it.

Check the new pre-filled information in ATO myTax matches the change in the letter from us. If it matches, re-submit it. If it doesn’t match, you can either:

-   change it yourself to match the details in the letter and re-submit it
-   [contact the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/contact-us) through their website.
