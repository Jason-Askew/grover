If you have been affected by the conflict in Ukraine, we can help you with payments and support while you’re in Australia.

If you are a Ukrainian national who has moved to Australia, you can apply for support depending on the type of visa you have.

## What visa types are eligible for support

The payments and health services you are eligible for will depend on the type of visa you have.

You must have an eligible visa such as:

-   Temporary Humanitarian Stay visa (subclass 449)
-   Temporary Humanitarian Concern visa (subclass 786)
-   Bridging visa E (subclass 050 or subclass 051) granted to you on or after 1 August 2022
-   Resolution of Status visa (subclass 851).

Read more about these visa types, the [Australian Government offer for Temporary Humanitarian Stay in Australia](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-and-support/ukraine-visa-support/australian-government-offer-for-temporary-humanitarian-stay-in-australia) and [Subclass 851 Resolution of Status](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/resolution-of-status-851) on the Department of Home Affairs website.

## What payment support you can get on a 449 or 786 visa

If you have a 449 or 786 visa, you can claim any of the following payments, without having to serve a waiting period. Read more about these payments:

-   [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy)
-   [Crisis Payment](/crisis-payment)

### What health services can you use

Medicare is a national insurance scheme that provides free or subsidised health services. It helps you access cheaper general health care.

If you have a 449 visa, you are not eligible for Medicare. You can still visit a doctor and seek medical care, but you won’t get lower cost health care covered by Medicare.

If you have a 786 visa, you can use Medicare to get lower cost health care.

Read more about [what’s covered by Medicare](/whats-covered-medicare) and how to [enrol in Medicare](/enrolling-medicare).

## What support you can get on a 050 or 051 visa

If you have a 050 or 051 visa, you can enrol for Medicare only.

Read more about [what’s covered by Medicare](/whats-covered-medicare?context=60092) and how to [enrol in Medicare](/enrolling-medicare?context=60092).

## What support you can get on a 851 visa

If you have a 851 visa, you can claim income support payments, without having to serve a waiting period. You can find which payment is right for you with the [Payment and Service Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payment-service-finder-start).

If you have a 851 visa, you can enrol for Medicare to get lower cost health care.

## What other help you can get

We have services and information to help you with other support you may need.

We have social workers who can help if you need to turn to someone for support.

They can help you with:

-   short term counselling
-   information
-   referrals to support services.

You can talk to a social worker over the phone by calling [Centrelink](/phone-us) and asking to speak with one. If you need an interpreter, let us know and we’ll arrange one for you. You can also call the [Centrelink multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).
