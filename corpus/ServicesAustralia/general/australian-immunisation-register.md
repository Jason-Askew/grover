# Australian Immunisation Register

The national register where your vaccinations are recorded.

Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way to protect against harmful diseases. The more people who get immunised, the less chance some diseases have to spread.

If you’re not immunised you may put people’s health at risk, especially:

-   babies
-   young children
-   frail older people
-   those who don’t have a strong immune system.

Find out more information about [childhood immunisations](https://www.health.gov.au/childhood-immunisation) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.
