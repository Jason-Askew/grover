For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

## What you need to know first

If you disagree or want more information about a decision we’ve made, you can ask for an explanation or apply for a formal review.

### Explanation of a decision

If you want more information about a decision we’ve made, you can ask us for an explanation at any time. We may be able to sort out your concerns without needing a formal review.

You can request a pause on debt repayments while you wait for an explanation of a debt decision.

Once you’ve asked for an explanation, an experienced staff member will call you to explain our decision. We aim to contact you within 14 days. If we can’t reach you by phone, we’ll send you a letter asking you to call us for an explanation.

You don’t have to pay for an explanation of a decision.

### Formal review

You can apply for a formal review of a decision we’ve made. You may want to apply for a formal review if you understand our decision but disagree with it. You don’t have to ask for an explanation first.

When you apply for a formal review, an Authorised Review Officer (ARO) will review the decision. The ARO will:

-   speak with you about the decision, where possible
-   look at the facts, the law, and the policy involved in the decision
-   change the decision if it’s wrong
-   contact you to let you know the outcome of your formal review.

You can also request a pause on debt repayments during a formal review of a debt decision.

You don’t have to pay for a formal review.

## When there are formal review delays

We aim to finish a formal review within 49 days from the date you applied. Some may take longer than this. It depends on the details of the review.

We have a high number of formal review applications in the queue for processing. This means it may take longer than usual before we get to your application.

If you’ve asked for a formal review, an ARO will attempt to contact you to discuss your review before they make a decision. There’s no need to call us to check on the progress of your formal review while it’s in the queue.

## How to pause your debt repayments

You can ask us to pause your debt repayments while we complete an explanation of our decision or a formal review. You can do this when you talk to us about the debt decision. The pause will generally be for 6 months. If your explanation or formal review takes longer than 6 months, your pause will be extended.

If you get a letter or SMS asking you to start making repayments and we haven’t finished your review, please contact us.

## When to apply for a formal review

You can apply for a formal review of a debt decision at any time for almost all of our payments.

Time limits apply for reviews of Tertiary Access Payment debt decisions.

You should apply for a formal review of most claim and entitlement decisions within 13 weeks from the date we tell you about the decision. You can still apply for a review after 13 weeks. If we change the decision, you may only get your entitlement from the date you applied for the formal review.

There is a limited time to apply for a formal review for some payments. Find out more about formal review time limits for:

## What you can do if you disagree with the Authorised Review Officer’s decision

If you disagree with the ARO’s decision, you can apply to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) for a review of the decision.

The ART reviews decisions made by Australian Government agencies, departments and ministers. Its name changed from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in 2024.

You can ask us to pause any debt repayments until the ART’s review is complete.

The ART is an independent tribunal. They can change decisions but only according to the law. Usually, they can only review a decision after an ARO has reviewed the decision.

There are different processes for reviews about:

-   [ABSTUDY](/when-you-can-apply-for-formal-review-abstudy-decision?context=64107)
-   [Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme](/when-you-can-apply-for-formal-review-assistance-for-isolated-children-decision?context=64107) decisions
-   some other decisions.

### When to apply to the ART

For Paid Parental Leave Scheme:

-   you have 28 days from the ARO’s decision to apply for an ART review if you’re a claimant
-   you have 14 days from the ARO’s decision to apply for an ART review if you’re an employer.

For some family assistance decisions, you should apply for an ART review within 90 days of receiving the ARO’s decision. There is no time limit for applying for an ART review if either of the following apply:

-   you get family assistance payments by instalment
-   the decision is about a family assistance debt.

For all other decisions, you should apply for an ART review within 13 weeks from when you receive the ARO’s decision. You can still apply for an ART review after 13 weeks. However, if the ART changes the decision, you may only be paid from the date you applied for the review.

### How to apply for an ART review

Follow the instructions on the [ART website](http://www.art.gov.au) to apply for an ART review.

After you submit an application, we’ll send the ART a statement. It will contain the reasons for our decision and relevant documents. You’ll also get a copy of our statement and documents.

There are 2 levels of review by the ART.

You may disagree with the outcome of the ART’s first review. If you do, you may be able to apply for a second ART review. You should make an application for a second ART review within 28 days of receiving the first ART review decision.

Decisions made by the ART are binding on both you and us. Either of us may appeal a decision made by the ART to the courts, but only on a question of law.

For some types of decisions, there may be an ART application fee.

We’re unable to assist you with the costs of pursuing a review by the ART. The ART is also unable to award you costs if you’re successful. We don’t ask you to pay our costs if you’re unsuccessful.

## What else you should know

### Legal assistance

### Compensation claims
