You must tell us within 14 days if your circumstances change.

For example, we need to know if:

-   you stop studying or change your study load.

## How to tell us

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov you can tell us about changes online.

You can also use the [Express Plus mobile app](/express-plus-mobile-apps).

## What happens if you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about changes, you may:

-   not get a payment next year
-   have to pay back your scholarship for this year.
