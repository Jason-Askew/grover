# How to register

Information to register your business for the Paid Parental Leave scheme.

If you are required to provide Parental Leave Pay to your employee, you must register your business or organisation with us online.

Provider Digital Access (PRODA) is an online identity verification and authentication system. It lets you securely access government online services. To access a service on behalf of an organisation, you may need to register the organisation in PRODA.

If you manage the payroll for businesses with different Australian Business Numbers (ABNs), you must register each business separately.

If we decide you must provide an employee’s Parental Leave Pay, we’ll send you a letter to let you know. Find out more about [how to respond to an Employer Determination letter](/how-to-respond-to-employer-determination-for-paid-parental-leave-scheme?context=23121).

You can also opt in to provide Parental Leave Pay to your employee even if you aren’t required to do it. If you want to do this, you need to opt in before your employee submits their claim.Learn more about [how to opt-in to provide Parental Leave Pay](/opt-to-provide-parental-leave-pay?context=23121).
