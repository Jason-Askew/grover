After you submit a claim, the claim status may appear as Submitted, In Progress, On hold or Completed.

If your claim status is on hold, check your online account for any new tasks and your myGov Inbox for any letters from us.

In Progress means we’re working on processing your claim now.

When the claim is completed, you’ll get a notification by SMS or email. We’ll also send you a letter.
