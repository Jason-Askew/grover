# Hours of subsidised child care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children

You can get 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight for each Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child in your care.

From 5 January 2026, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children can get 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight. Families will still pay an out-of-pocket cost to their child care service, depending on their [Child Care Subsidy (CCS) percentage](/your-income-can-affect-child-care-subsidy?context=41186#familyincomeccs).

It’s voluntary to tell us if you care for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child. If you choose not to tell us, your CCS won’t change.

If you get 100 hours of CCS or if your family’s [recognised participation types](/recognised-participation-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) change, you should still tell us.

Families where all CCS eligible children have been identified as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child won’t need to provide recognised participation details.

For periods before 5 January 2026, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children could get at least 36 hours of subsidised child care each fortnight.
