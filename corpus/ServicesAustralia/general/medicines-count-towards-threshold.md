# Medicines that count towards the threshold

Know which medicines will count towards the PBS Safety Net threshold.

You can reach the threshold by buying PBS medicines and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) medicines at:

-   community pharmacies
-   private hospitals approved to supply PBS medicines
-   outpatient pharmacies at public hospitals.

Non-PBS medicines you get from the outpatient pharmacy of a public hospital can count toward the PBS Safety Net.

Ask your pharmacist which medicines will count towards the PBS Safety Net threshold.

You’ll need to [keep track of your medicines](/keep-track-your-pbs-medicines?context=22016) to know when you’ve reached the threshold.

When there are 2 or more brands of the same medicine, they may have different prices. If you choose a more expensive brand, the extra cost you pay may not count towards the threshold. Your pharmacist can tell you which brands cost more and how much will count towards the threshold.

You can read more about [generic medicines vs. brand-name medicines](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/generic-medicines-vs-brand-name-medicines) on the healthdirect website.

## When you get your medicines early

If you get an early supply of medicine, the amount won’t count towards your PBS Safety Net threshold.

If you’ve reached the threshold, you can’t get an early supply of medicine at the reduced PBS Safety Net rate.
