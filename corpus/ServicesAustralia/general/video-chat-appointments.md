Depending on the type of payment or service you get, you may be able to use video chat to do your business with us.

## Who can get a video chat appointment

We may offer video chat if you:

-   are an older Australian, carer or nominee who needs help from an Aged Care Specialist Officer
-   need to speak with a FIS Officer to help you understand your financial situation
-   get a Farm Household Allowance (FHA) and you need to speak with your Farm Household Case Officer (FHCO).
-   are a student or job seeker claiming Austudy, JobSeeker Payment or Youth Allowance.

## How video chat appointments work

Our video chats are voluntary.

Once you’ve booked a time, you’ll get a secure online letter in your myGov Inbox. It will include a link to your video chat. We’ll also include instructions on how to prepare for your appointment.

You can only join the video chat from either:

-   the secure online letter in your myGov Inbox
-   your Centrelink online account or Express Plus Centrelink app under Manage Appointments.

## How to access your video chat appointment

You’ll need access to the internet. You can use your own smart phone, tablet, computer or laptop with a microphone and a camera.

To access your video chat appointment, use the link in your myGov Inbox. The link will also appear in your Centrelink online account and your Express Plus Centrelink mobile app under Manage Appointments.

You need to open your appointment a few minutes before your booked time. When you click the link, it will open on your device.

The video chat appointment will open using your device’s preferred internet browser. Video chat won’t work in all internet browsers. Our video chats work best on either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. If you don’t have one of these browsers, you might need to download one if you’re experiencing issues.

If the link opens in another browser, you can copy and paste the link into either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

If you need extra support to get onto your video chat appointment, we have some online guides to step you through the process:
