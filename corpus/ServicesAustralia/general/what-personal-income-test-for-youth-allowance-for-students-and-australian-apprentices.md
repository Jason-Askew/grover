# What the personal income test is

We check your personal income to see if you’re eligible for Youth Allowance and work out how much you’ll get.

## on this page

-   [Effect on your payment](#a1)
-   [Other tests that affect your payment](#othertests)

We apply the personal income test when you claim and report your income each fortnight. It helps us work out your payment.

We may also use [other tests](#othertests) and base your rate on the test that results in the lowest payment rate.

## Effect on your payment

If you are an eligible student or Australian Apprentice, we start to reduce your payment if your personal income is over $539 a fortnight.

Personal income is your gross income. This is the income you get before any deductions, like tax. It doesn’t include [child support](/compare-your-child-support-collection-options) payments.

Your [Income Bank](/income-bank) helps you keep more of your payment. It allows you to build credits when your income is less than $539 a fortnight. Then use the credits in the fortnights when your income is more.

This table shows how your income affects your payment. The amounts are before tax.

You can also use the [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to estimate your payment. What you could get depends on how much you earn each fortnight.

### If you’ve been on another payment

The amount of income you can earn may be higher if all of these apply:

-   you’re 22 or older
-   you’ve been getting an income support payment that isn’t a student payment for at least 26 of the last 39 weeks
-   you don’t have a dependent child.

You must also have started either of the following after turning 22:

-   a course with a duration of at least 12 months
-   an Australian Apprenticeship.

### If your payment reduces to $0

## Other tests that affect your payment

Other tests that affect how much Youth Allowance you can get include the:

-   [personal assets test](/what-personal-assets-test-for-youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916)
-   [parental means test](/what-parental-means-test-for-youth-allowance-students-and-australian-apprentices?context=43916), if you’re dependent

Income

Most types of income count in your income test. We use this and your assets test to assess if you can get a payment, and to calculate your rate of payment.
