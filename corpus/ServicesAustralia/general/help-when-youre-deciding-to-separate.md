## If you’ve decided to separate

### Updating your personal details

If you’ve decided to separate from your partner, you’ll need to make sure you update your personal information. This may include your home address and bank account details. You should do this as soon as possible so your information is safe.

After separation, you’ll need to work out arrangements for your children. This includes finances, property and [learning about child support](/learning-about-child-support?context=60015).

Applying for a child support assessment can take time. If you need one, you should apply for it as soon as possible.

You can start a new child support case online.
