For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

You should always tell us if you’re leaving Australia. This includes when you’re going on a cruise into international waters.

If you leave Australia to live in another country, your payment will stop when you depart.

If your travel is short term, your payment will stop when you depart, unless you’re travelling for an approved reason.

You may get JobSeeker Payment because of a residence exemption available to some [New Zealand citizens](/new-zealand-citizens-claiming-payments-australia?context=51411). If you do and your payment stops while you’re overseas, you won’t get the exemption again when you return.

[
