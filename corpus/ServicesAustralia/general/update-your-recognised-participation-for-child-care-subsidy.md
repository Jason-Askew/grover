# Update your recognised participation

We use your recognised participation and circumstances to work out the hours of subsidised child care you can get.

The hours of subsidised care you can get per fortnight depends on the hours of [recognised participation](/hours-subsidised-child-care-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186) you do and your circumstances. If your recognised participation changes, your hours of subsidised care may also change.

If you have a partner, we’ll use the lower of your or your partner’s recognised participation and family circumstances to work out your hours of subsidised child care.

Find out more about [how your recognised participation can affect your Child Care Subsidy](/hours-subsidised-child-care-for-child-care-subsidy?context=41186).
