# Received the maximum period of payment

We can help you when you reach the end of your time on Farm Household Allowance (FHA).

You can get FHA for up to 4 years in specific 10-year periods.

The first 10-year period was 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2024.

The current 10-year period is from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2034.

If you used your 4 years before 1 July 2024, you can re-apply.

If you were receiving FHA as one 10-year period ended and the current 10-year period began:

-   you would’ve been given the choice to opt out of receiving the payment
-   if you didn’t opt out, your payment continued
-   your FHA payment for up to 4 years restarted from 1 July 2024.

When you enter the fourth year of payment, talk to your Farm Household Case Officer. They can help you to transition off the payment. Read more about [help with other payments and services as you transition off FHA](/help-with-other-payments-and-services-you-transition-fha?context=22161).
