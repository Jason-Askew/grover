## Acting for someone else

When you act for someone it means you manage their Medicare affairs for them. There must be a good reason why they can’t do this. For instance, they may not be able to make decisions because of illness or disability.

There are 3 reasons why you can act for someone:

-   you have their power of attorney
-   you’re their legal guardian or administrator
-   you need to act for them because they can’t act for themselves.

If you’re acting for someone, you may be able to:

-   ask us questions on their behalf
-   make decisions about Medicare for them
-   update their contact and bank details
-   make Medicare claims for them.

You can’t manage their Medicare affairs with us online.

## If you have a Power of Attorney (POA)

You just need to register it with us. You can either:

-   take the original power of attorney document to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   [email](/write-to-us?context=64107#medicare) or [post](/write-to-us) a certified copy of this document to us.

You’ll need to give us the person’s Medicare card number and your Identification.

This can be either your:

-   Australian Birth Certificate
-   Australian Citizenship Certificate
-   Australian Drivers licence
-   valid Australian passport
-   Foreign passport with a current Australian visa
-   valid ImmiCard.

## If a court has made you the person’s guardian or administrator

You need to register it with us. You can either:

-   take the original or certified copy of the court order to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/)
-   [email](/write-to-us?context=64107#medicare) or [post](/write-to-us) a certified copy of this document to us.

You’ll need to give us the person’s Medicare card number and your Identification.

This can be either your:

-   Australian Birth Certificate
-   Australian Citizenship Certificate
-   Australian Drivers licence
-   valid Australian passport

-   ImmiCard.

## Applying to act for someone else

You need to apply to us if you want to act for someone and either:

-   you don’t have their power of attorney
-   you’re not their legal guardian or administrator.

To act for someone they must be unable to manage their own affairs.

You must:

-   be 18 or older
-   be a close friend or relative of the person
-   not have a paid job as their carer
