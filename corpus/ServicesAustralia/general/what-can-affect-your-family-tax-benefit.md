Some things can impact your Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Payment.

If you get FTB, you must tell us if [your circumstances change](/change-circumstances-while-getting-family-tax-benefit?context=22151).

Your FTB Part A may reduce if your child doesn't meet:

-   [immunisation requirements](/what-are-immunisation-requirements?context=22151)
-   [Healthy Start for School requirements](/healthy-start-for-school-health-check?context=22151).

If you or your partner get child support, these payments can affect your FTB Part A. Read more about [child support and your FTB Part A](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=22151).

Your FTB could change depending on the amount of time the child is in your care, or [when your child turns 16 or stops studying](/family-tax-benefit-when-your-child-16-to-19-and-stops-full-time-study-or-school?context=22151).

There are rules about how long you can get FTB when you, or a dependent child, [travel outside Australia](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-family-tax-benefit?context=22151).

Read more about how [your percentage of care affects your FTB payments](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-family-tax-benefit-ftb-payments?context=22151).
