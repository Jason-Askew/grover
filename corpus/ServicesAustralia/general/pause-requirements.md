## Pause of requirements

During this period, no payment suspensions or financial penalties will apply if you don’t meet your requirements.

You must still report any income you and your partner get every 2 weeks, even if it’s $0. This is so we can pay you the right amount.

You can stay up to date with information about pauses of mutual obligation or participation requirements by continuing to check this page for updates.
