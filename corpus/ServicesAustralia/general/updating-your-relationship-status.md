# Updating your relationship status

You need to tell us when you become a member of a couple or end a relationship. This is to make sure you get paid correctly.

For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

If you have a partner, we generally consider you a member of a couple. We [define a relationship](/making-your-relationship-official?context=60029) as any of the following:

-   married
-   in a registered relationship
-   in a de facto relationship.

If you’re not sure whether you’re a member of a couple, we may need to [assess your relationship](/getting-together-for-relationship-changes?context=60029#assesscouple).

It’s important to tell us when your relationship changes. If you don’t, we may pay you the wrong amount and you’ll have to repay the money. There may be other penalties.

To tell us about a change in your relationship, you may need to complete a form. The way you tell us will depend on which payment or service you get.

## When you have relationship safety concerns

There’s help available if you’re experiencing [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence), or you’re concerned about your own or your family’s safety. Family and domestic violence is any behaviour that’s violent, threatening, controlling or intended to make you or your family feel scared and unsafe.

If you’re in immediate danger call 000.

To access 24/7 counselling and support, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732.

If you’re concerned about your own or your family’s safety, you can also call your [regular payment line](/phone-us) and ask to speak with a social worker.

If you don’t usually call us, you can call the [Employment Services line](/phone-us#jobseekers) and ask to speak with a social worker.

## When you start a relationship

If you start a relationship, you’ll need to complete and return the [partner details form](/mod-p?context=60029). You need to do this if you get any payments or concession cards from us except Parenting Payment Single (PPS).

If you’re getting PPS, you’ll need to [claim Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP)](/how-to-claim-parenting-payment).

### Partner claims

If your partner is making an online claim, they may be able to make a claim for you at the same time. We call this a combined partner claim.

Your partner will be able to make a combined partner claim if they meet all the requirements. We’ll tell them in the claim if they can do this, and we’ll notify you if your partner has made a claim for you.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can review the details your partner has given us. You can confirm your relationship status online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If your partner claims a payment that isn’t a combined partner claim, you’ll need to [confirm your relationship status](/confirm-your-relationship-status-when-making-claim?context=60029) with us.

## When you separate

You need to tell us if you separate from your partner.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can tell us online if you get any of the following payments:

-   Age Pension
-   Austudy
-   Carer Payment
-   Disabilty Support Pension
-   JobSeeker Payment
-   Youth Allowance for job seekers
-   Youth Allowance for students and Australian Apprentices.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you can’t tell us online you can use the [separation details form](/mod-s).

If you’ve told us about your separation as part of a new claim for a payment, you don’t need to use this form.

### If you separate with children

We have information and can help with child support arrangements between [separated parents](/separated-parents).

If you’re getting Parenting Payment Partnered (PPP), you’ll need to lodge a claim for a different payment. If you’re the principal carer of a child under 14, you may be eligible for Parenting Payment Single (PPS).

If you only get a family payment and won’t be claiming another payment when you separate call us on the [Families line](#toolbar-phone).

Family payments include:

-   Family Tax Benefit
-   Child Care Subsidy.

### If you’re living with someone you were previously in a relationship with

If you’re separated and live in the same house as your ex-partner, you need to tell us. You’ll each need to complete and return a [Relationship details - Separated under one roof form](/ss293?context=60029), so we can [assess if you’re a couple](/getting-together-for-relationship-changes?context=60029#assesscouple).

This form can’t be used to tell us of your separation. If you’ve separated from your partner you and your partner must tell us separately through myGov or using a [separation details form](/mod-s).

If getting your partner to complete a Relationship Details form will put your safety at risk, they don’t need to complete this form. If you have any safety concerns with asking your ex-partner to complete it, please tell us on your form.

If you’re separated under one roof, we’ll need to regularly review your living arrangements. This is so we pay you the right amount.

Contact numbers available on this page.

### Centrelink families line

Use this line if you need help with family payments, such as Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Subsidy, Parental Leave Pay, Foster Child Health Care Card, Health Care Card or Pensioner Concession Card.

[136 150](tel:136150)

Monday to Friday 8 am to 8 pm

If your child’s Youth Allowance payment has been suspended, it may be because we still need information about your income. We may have sent your child a letter asking for this in September or October, read how you can [update your income details online](/updating-parental-income-details).

There are other ways you may want to [contact us](/contact-us).
