# Limits on Away from Base Assistance

There are limits on the number of trips and the number of days you can get Away from Base Assistance.

## on this page

-   [Most students](#a1)
-   [Masters or Doctorate students](#a2)
-   [Attending a testing or assessment](#a3)

The amount of assistance you get depends on how many activities you have to attend. It will also depend on how long your course is each year.

If you need to stay away extra nights while travelling, we don’t count them in the maximum number of days. Usually this is because travel schedules force you to stay away for more nights.

## Most students

We use the length of your course to work out the maximum number of return trips we’ll pay for. We also use this to work out the maximum number of days we’ll cover costs for. It doesn’t matter if you’re a full time or a part time student, the limits are the same.

If you’re doing a course that’s between 24 weeks and 1 year we may pay up to:

-   6 return trips
-   40 day of meals and accommodation costs.

If you’re doing a course that’s between 17 and 23 weeks we may pay up to:

-   4 return trips
-   30 days of meals and accommodation costs.

If you’re doing a course that’s between 12 and 16 weeks we may pay up to:

-   3 return trips
-   20 days of meals and accommodation costs.

If you’re doing a short course that’s less than 12 weeks, we may pay up to:

-   2 return trips
-   10 days of meals and accommodation costs, provided it does not exceed 50% of the course length.

## Masters or Doctorate students

If you’re a Masters or Doctorate student, we’ll only pay up to $2,080 a year.

## Attending a testing or assessment

If you're attending a testing or assessment activity we’ll pay for a maximum of 2 trips a year.
