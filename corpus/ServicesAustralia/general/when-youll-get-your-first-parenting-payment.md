If your Centrelink account isn’t linked to myGov, find out how to [set it up](/setting-up-online-accounts-for-centrelink?context=22196) so you can check your claim.

If you claimed over the phone, we’ll send you a message to let you know your claim outcome. If your claim is successful, we’ll let you know both:

-   when you’ll get your first payment
-   how much you’ll get.

Some people will have a one week [ordinary waiting period](/ordinary-waiting-period?context=22196) before they get their first payment. In some circumstances, you may have to wait longer if other waiting periods apply.

## You got a lump sum payment when you finished work

You may have to wait if your employer paid you a lump sum such as annual leave or redundancy when you left. The waiting period is relative to the lump sum payment. Read more about [income maintenance periods](/income-maintenance-period?context=22196).

## You left your job voluntarily or lost it due to misconduct

You may have to wait depending on the circumstances if both of the following apply:

-   you’re single and your youngest child is 6 or older
-   you chose to leave your job or you lost it due to misconduct.

## You recently finished seasonal work

You may have to wait if you or your partner finished seasonal, contract or intermittent work in the 6 months before claiming.

The time you need to wait depends on how much you earned and how long you were working. Read about the [seasonal work preclusion period](/seasonal-work-preclusion-period?context=22196).

## You’re new to Australia

If you’ve recently arrived in Australia as a resident, you may have to wait up to 4 years to qualify. Read about the [newly arrived resident’s waiting period](/newly-arrived-residents-waiting-period?context=22196).

## You’ve had a compensation payment

If you’ve had a lump sum compensation payment, you may have to wait a period relative to your lump sum payment. Use our [estimator](/when-to-use-centrelink-compensation-estimator) or [contact us](/contact-us) for information about your compensation preclusion period.
