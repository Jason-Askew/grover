Use these lists as a helpful guide only. They’re not a complete list of tasks for every situation, but they can help you start planning for changes. Print this page and keep it handy.

## Children

You may need to:

-   decide on your initial care arrangements
-   think about your [child support assessment](/child-support-assessment) options
-   speak to your child’s school or child care so they are aware.

Your child’s school or child care staff may need to give your child additional support.

## Finances

You may want to:

-   separate any joint accounts
-   check for any payments you can get
-   if you already get Family Tax Benefit (FTB), check if your [FTB Part A payment rates](/family-tax-benefit-part-payment-rates?context=22151) will change
-   update your contact details and ownership of any bank accounts, credit cards, registrations and super funds
-   speak to your lender if you have a joint mortgage
-   update your contact and billing details for other accounts, like toll accounts and subscription services
-   speak to one of our [Financial Information Service Officers](/financial-information-service-officers) for advice on your financial future
-   get free [financial help and information](/getting-financial-help-and-information) from us and other third parties, including help finding a financial counsellor or getting help with debt
-   update your contact details with your insurance providers.

## Medical

During this time, it’s important to think about your [child’s health and safety](/child-health-and-safety).

You may need to:

-   [update your personal details for Medicare](/how-you-update-your-name-date-birth-or-gender-for-medicare)
-   [remove someone from your Medicare card](/remove-someone-from-medicare-card) by requesting a new card for yourself and your children
-   update your details with your private health insurance provider.

You should also let us know about the separation if you’re registered for the [Medicare Safety Net](/how-to-manage-your-medicare-safety-net).

## Legal

You may want to:

-   seek legal advice to update your will, power of attorney, next of kin and emergency contacts
-   make copies of important documents and give them to your lawyer or trusted friend or family member.

If you get a payment, check if you need to update any [nominee arrangements](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=60015).

### Making a will

Creating a valid will is important, even if it isn’t easy to think about. A will states what you want to happen to your estate after you die.

If you have a child support case and die without a will, this can affect your family, and how the child support is collected from and disbursed to your estate.

## Living arrangements

You may want to:

-   talk about your living arrangements with your ex-partner if it’s safe
-   update your lease with your real estate agent if you rent
-   update your contact and billing details for utilities, such as energy and mobile services
-   organise for the post office to redirect your mail if you move.

If you feel unsafe doing any of these things, we can help. Find out how we can help you with [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence) concerns.

## Keeping your information safe

If you’re leaving a relationship or living with violence or abuse, there are some things you need to do to [keep your information safe](/keeping-your-information-safe-when-leaving-relationship).
