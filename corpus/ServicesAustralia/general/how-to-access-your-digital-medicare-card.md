# How to access your digital Medicare card

You can use the myGov app to access your digital Medicare card and your Organ Donor card if you have one.

To use a digital version of your Medicare card, you need to add it to your wallet in the myGov app.

You’ll be able to view your Medicare number and who’s listed on your digital card.

To access Medicare services in the myGov app, you need a myGov account with Medicare linked to it. If you don’t have this, you’ll need to [set it up](/how-to-set-up-your-medicare-online-account) before you can download the app.

Follow these steps to add your digital Medicare or Organ Donor cards to your wallet in the myGov app:

1.  Open your myGov app.
2.  Go to **Wallet** on your home screen.
3.  Select the **plus** icon and follow the steps.

Find out more about the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) and [wallet](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app/using-the-mygov-app) on the myGov website.

Learn more about the [Australian Organ Donor Register](/australian-organ-donor-register).

It’s a good idea to still carry your physical Medicare card with you.
