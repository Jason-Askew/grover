# Disaster events where you have flexible debt repayment choices

If you’re affected by a declared disaster event in your state or territory, you can change or pause your debt repayments.

If you’re affected by a declared disaster event, you can do one of the following:

-   pause your repayments for up to 6 months
-   change the amount you’re repaying
-   continue your repayments.

Flexible debt repayment choices are available for people living in disaster declared Local Government Areas (LGAs). The government may announce additional LGAs to be added to a declared disaster event at a later time. You can find out if your area is affected by selecting your state and entering your postcode into the filter.

If you’re in financial hardship, call one of the following:

-   your [regular Centrelink payment line](/phone-us)
-   the [Centrelink debt recovery line](/phone-us#centrelinkdebt)
-   the [Centrelink Indigenous debt recovery line](/phone-us#indigenousdebt) if you’re an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian
-   the [Centrelink multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages) for help in your language.
