For Centrelink payments and services, you can call our [multilingual phone service](/phone-us#languages).

How long you get payment for depends on your situation.

If you, or the person getting care, leave Australia to live in another country, your payment will stop when you depart.

You must tell us within 14 days if either you or the person you care for goes overseas.

## If you travel with the person getting care

You’ll get Carer Allowance for 6 weeks if you and the person you care for leave Australia together temporarily.

## If you travel without the person getting care

If you leave Australia temporarily without the person you care for, you’ll get Carer Allowance either:

-   for the first 6 weeks of your trip
-   until you run out of [breaks from caring](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-allowance?context=21811).

You’ll get it for whichever option happens first.

## If the person getting care is your child younger than 16

You’ll get Carer Allowance for the first 6 weeks of your trip if your child stays with your partner.

## If the person getting care travels without you

If the person you care for travels overseas without you, you’ll keep getting Carer Allowance until you run out of [breaks from caring](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-allowance?context=21811) days.
