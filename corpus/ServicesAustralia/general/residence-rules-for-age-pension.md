# Residence rules

To be eligible for Age Pension you must meet the residence rules.

## on this page

-   [How long you need to have been a resident](#a1)
-   [How else you may meet the rules](#howelsemeetrules)

On the day you claim you must be all of the following:

-   [living in Australia](/residence-descriptions?context=22526#livinginaustralia)
-   physically in Australia
-   an Australian resident.

You are an Australian resident if you are living long-term in Australia and are either:

-   an Australian citizen
-   a permanent visa holder
-   a protected Special Category visa (SCV) holder from New Zealand.

There are exceptions if you are claiming under a [Social Security Agreement](/international-social-security-agreements).

## How long you need to have been a resident

To get Age Pension you generally need to have been an Australian resident for at least 10 years in total. For at least 5 of these years, there must be no break in your residence.

We may need more information to establish your Australian residence history. If we do, we’ll ask you to complete the [Residence in Australia and other countries form](/mod-o).

## How else you may meet the rules

Some people can get Age Pension if they’ve been an Australian resident for less than 10 years.

### Refugee or former refugee

If you’re a refugee or former refugee you are exempt from the 10 year rule.

### If you’re a woman whose partner has died

If you’re a woman whose partner has died, you may be eligible for Age Pension. To get this, both of the following must apply to you:

-   you must be an Australian resident for the 2 years before you claim
-   both of you must have been Australian residents when your partner died.

### Lived or worked overseas

If you’ve lived or worked in an agreement country you may be able to get Age Pension. Find out which [countries have agreements with us](/international-social-security-agreements).

#### Recently returned to Australia to live

If you return to Australia to live after residing overseas, there is no waiting period to claim Age Pension. You must still meet all qualification rules to be eligible for payment. If granted, your payment may stop if you [travel outside Australia](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-age-pension?context=22526) within 2 years of returning to live.
