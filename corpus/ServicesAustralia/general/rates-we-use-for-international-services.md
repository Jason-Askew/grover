# Rates we use

We use the buying rate from the Commonwealth Bank as the exchange rate for most currencies. For other currencies we get the rates from other banks.

We get the exchange rates from the banks 5 working days before the first working day of the next month.

We update the exchange rates we use on the first working day of each month.

For family assistance payments we treat overseas income differently.

Foreign income for family assistance

Foreign income can affect how much Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and Child Care Subsidy (CCS) you get.
