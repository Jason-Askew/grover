# Work Bonus balance

We use your Work Bonus balance to offset your eligible income so you keep more of your pension if you’re working.

You’ll accrue $300 to your Work Bonus balance each fortnight, up to a maximum of $11,800.

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can check your Work Bonus balance online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Under **Payments and claims** select **My payments**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

## Starting balance

The starting balance for your Work Bonus depends on when you submit your claim.

### Claims submitted before 1 July 2024

If you lodged a claim between 1 December 2022 and 30 June 2024 you’ll get a one-off boost of $4,000 to your Work Bonus balance if you haven’t received one before.

Your total Work Bonus balance can’t be more than the maximum of $11,800.

### Claims submitted after 1 July 2024

When you claim an eligible payment for the first time, you’ll start with a Work Bonus balance of $4,000.

If you’re re-claiming an eligible payment, any Work Bonus balance you already had will carry over. If your balance is less than $4000, your balance may be topped up to $4,000 if it hasn’t been topped up in the last 2 years.

You’ll also get a one-off boost to your Work Bonus balance of $4,000 if you meet all the following:

-   you were over Age Pension age and getting a Work Bonus eligible payment before 1 December 2022
-   you stopped getting a Work Bonus eligible payment before 1 December 2022
-   you haven’t got a one-off Work Bonus balance boost of $4,000 before.
