This privacy notice outlines how we manage personal information for the Organisation Register.

## Why we collect your information

We collect and use your personal information on behalf of the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA). We collect it for the purposes of:

-   developing and managing the Organisation Register
-   administering programs utilising the Organisation Register.

Some programs that use the Organisation Register include:

-   MyMedicare and MyMedicare Incentives
-   Medicare Urgent Care Clinics
-   General Practice Training Payment Program
-   Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Storage Funding Program.

The Organisation Register is a register of health organisations, their associated sites, and health professionals, including GPs. Organisations can create an organisation site record and link health professionals to the organisation sites where they provide services. The health organisation and site where health professionals deliver services can view information on health professionals linked to them.

We’ll update your information on the Organisation Register due to the following:

-   when you update your professional information in another system administered by Services Australia
-   when a provider number is created for a new site during a relocation, and unlinks the provider number from the previous site location
-   when you update your location start and end date of your provider number
-   when you close provider numbers
-   if you’re deceased.

## How we use your information

We’ll use your information on the Organisation Register to allow correspondence to be sent to and received by you using Health Professional Online Services (HPOS).

We’ll also use your information to administer and manage the MyMedicare program, including:

-   linkage to the MyMedicare program which involves collecting personal information about you to confirm your eligibility to participate
-   to enable a patient to select a Preferred GP when registering or managing their MyMedicare
-   to administer the MyMedicare program and MyMedicare incentives
-   to display updated details to patients in the patient’s Medicare online account through myGov
-   to validate Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and DVA specific claims, using information about your linkage to a general practice and your eligibility to participate in MyMedicare
-   to generate notifications for a range of matters. This includes to update you, the organisation and general practice you are linked to, when you’re no longer eligible to participate in the MyMedicare program
-   to report on the MyMedicare program. These reports are only available to a limited number of Services Australia, the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing, and DVA staff for the purpose of managing the MyMedicare program.

We may use automated decision-making systems and tools to help us provide you with the services, and undertake the activities, described in this privacy notice when accessing your personal information. If we use these systems and tools, we will comply with all applicable laws when doing so. Our use of these systems and tools does not affect any rights you may have to request a review of a decision we make.
