Homelessness is a problem that goes beyond not having safe shelter.

Being homeless includes:

-   living in a refuge
-   staying in crisis accommodation
-   being in temporary housing
-   having to couch surf
-   sheltering in a car
-   living in a severely overcrowded home.

If you need help now, you can find shelter, food and other support in your area on the [AskIzzy website](https://askizzy.org.au/).

## Help to get payments

What payments you can get can depend on your circumstances. Use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what you may be eligible for.

We can make payments into your bank account or the bank account of an [authorised nominee](/someone-to-act-for-you-with-medicare-centrelink-aged-care-or-child-support?context=60023).

## Advance payment

If you already get income support from us, you may be able to get an [advance lump sum payment](/advance-payment).

## Other available help

Moneysmart can direct you to charities and community organisations that can help you.
