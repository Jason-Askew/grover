# Automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) use

We’re committed to the safe, ethical and responsible use of AI and automation to improve the delivery of government services.

Automation helps our staff to complete repetitive tasks like writing letters, issuing new concession cards and pre-filling data on customer records. We also use it to process some basic claims that have predictable and repeatable outcomes.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps us make some processes faster and easier. AI is used in adaptive automation and intelligent automation. Adaptive automation learns and evolves using input data to generate human-like responses. ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot are examples of this. Intelligent automation recommends a course of action based on defined parameters. An example is how digital audio streaming services, like Spotify, can recommend new music based on your listening history.

We’re trialling AI in controlled environments to find safe, responsible, ethical and appropriate uses of the technology. We don’t use any systems with live customer data in our trials, and we don’t share sensitive or classified data of any kind with public generative AI tools.

We assess use cases through our governance and assurance processes before we apply them.

## Automation and AI Strategy

The Automation and AI Strategy 2025-27 sets the direction for how we’ll use automation and AI to modernise and enhance services and payments.
