You can get your new card online if you meet all of these requirements:

-   you’re living in Australia and you’re an Australian citizen, New Zealand citizen or you have a permanent resident visa
-   you’re 15 or older
-   you’re only on one Medicare card
-   someone else doesn’t act on your behalf for Medicare purposes

### Add your children under 15

When you apply for your new card online, you can add your children under 15 if they meet all of these requirements:

-   they’re on your current Medicare card
-   they’re under 15
-   they’re only on one Medicare card.

We’ll copy them to your new card. Their name will be on both your card and their original card. This means both cards remain valid.

You can [read our online guide about getting a new card with other people](/medicare-online-account-help-get-new-medicare-card-with-other-people).

You’ll need to use a form if either of these apply:

-   you or your children under 15 don’t meet all of these requirements
-   you don’t want your children to remain on their current card.
