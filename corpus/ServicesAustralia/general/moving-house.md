# Moving house

Find out how moving house can affect your payments and services from us.

Even if you don’t currently get a payment from us, tell us if you move so that we can get in touch with you if we need to.

If you get a payment from us, you need to tell us your new address within 14 days.

When you move, you may be eligible for extra payments.

We have payments that can help with moving costs and rent, depending on your situation. There are also payments to help if you’re living in a rural or remote area.
