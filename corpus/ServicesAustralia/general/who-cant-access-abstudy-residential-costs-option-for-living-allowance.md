# Who can’t access it

You can’t access the residential costs option if you get certain scholarships or are an Australian Apprentice.

You can’t access it if you're either:

-   getting the [Relocation Scholarship](/relocation-scholarship), unless you're offered a place in a residential college after we pay the scholarship
-   an Australian Apprentice.

You also can't access it if you get an Indigenous Student Success Programme (ISSP) scholarship:

-   Indigenous Commonwealth Education Costs Scholarships
-   Indigenous Commonwealth Accommodation Costs Scholarships
-   Indigenous Commonwealth Reward Scholarships.

You can read about [ISSP scholarships](https://www.niaa.gov.au/our-work/early-childhood-development-and-education/indigenous-student-success-program) on the Department of National Indigenous Australians Agency website.

## Example if you got the Relocation Scholarship after you were offered residential accommodation

At the beginning of the year, Sita declined an offer of a room in a college. Instead, she accepted an offer of a Commonwealth Scholarship. Later, she realised it would be better to stay on campus to complete her studies. She then accepted the offer for a room at residential accommodation. Sita isn't eligible for residential cost option because she's getting the Commonwealth Scholarship and it pays for her accommodation.
