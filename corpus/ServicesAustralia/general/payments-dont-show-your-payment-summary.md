# Payments that don’t show on it

Your payment summary won’t show some taxable payments you get from us. But if you get any, you'll need to report them in your tax return.

You can check the amount of any payments you got:

If you lodge your tax return online using the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) myTax, you can declare the amount under the Australian Government special payments section. You can read about [Australian Government special payments](http://www.ato.gov.au/myTax25GvtSpecialPayments) on the ATO website.

If you lodge your tax return by paper, declare the payments in the other income section at question 24.

If you have a registered tax agent or accountant, ask them to include the payments.
