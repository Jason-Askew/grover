# Support services

There are support services to help you after the loss of someone close to you.

It may seem difficult at first to take part in social groups and activities. You may or may not want people around you. There are support services such as counsellors available to help in times of grief.

Talk with your doctor or local community health centre about your situation. They can give you information and refer you to support and counselling services.
