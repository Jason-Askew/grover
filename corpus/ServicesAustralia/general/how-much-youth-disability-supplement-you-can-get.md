# How much you can get

How much Youth Disability Supplement you can get depends on how much your main payment is. We pay the supplement with your income support payment fortnightly.

-   [Limit if you’re on Disability Support Pension (DSP)](#a1)
-   [Limit if you’re on Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY](#a2)
-   [Income and assets tests apply](#a3)

The most Youth Disability Supplement you can get is $162.60 a fortnight. To work out the total amount you can get, we add up your income support payment and the Youth Disability Supplement. We do this to make sure the total combined amount you get is under the payment limits outlined below.

## Limit if you’re on Disability Support Pension (DSP)

The total you get each fortnight can’t be more than what someone older than 21 would get on DSP.

If you get [DSP](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension), you won’t pay tax on the supplement.

## Limit if you’re on Youth Allowance or ABSTUDY

The total you get each fortnight can’t be more than what someone older than 22 would get on [JobSeeker Payment](/jobseeker-payment).

If you get [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance) or [ABSTUDY](/abstudy), you may have to pay tax on the supplement.

## Income and assets tests apply

We pay the Youth Disability Supplement with your main payment. We apply the same income test rules to this supplement as we do for your main payment.

If you’re on [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance) or [ABSTUDY](/abstudy), this may include the [parental income test](/youth-allowance-income-and-assets-tests).
