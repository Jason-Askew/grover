# Mental health

We can help you access mental health support services in certain circumstances.

We can help if any of the following apply:

-   you feel depressed or anxious
-   you’re experiencing thoughts of suicide or self-harm
-   you have a mental illness or disorder.

If you need extra support, [Service Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/service-finder) can help you find services in your area.
