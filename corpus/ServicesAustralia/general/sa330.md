# Details of income stream product form (SA330)

Use this form to give us information about your income stream, so we can calculate your payment.

How to use our forms

You must [download our forms and fill them in](/how-to-use-our-forms) so they are processed quickly. You can also electronically sign some of our forms. We have help available if you use assistive technology or need an interpreter.

Download and complete the [Details of income stream product form](/sites/default/files/2024-11/sa330-2412en-f.pdf "PDF document").

This form must be completed by either:

-   your income stream provider
-   the trustee or administrator of your self-managed superannuation fund
-   the trustee of your small APRA fund.

They need to complete a separate form for each [income stream](/income-streams#types).
