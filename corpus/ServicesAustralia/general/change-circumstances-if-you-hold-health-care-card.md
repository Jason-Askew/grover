## What to tell us

You have 14 days to tell us if any of the following happen:

-   your personal circumstances change, for example if you become partnered or separated
-   your care arrangements change
-   your work or study load changes
-   your income goes up
-   you start or return to work
-   you change your address.

If you stop getting your payment, we’ll cancel your Health Care Card.

If you return to work, you can keep your card for up to 6 months. But you must have got a payment from us for one year or more. Read more about [returning to work](/who-can-get-health-care-card?context=21981#returntowork).
