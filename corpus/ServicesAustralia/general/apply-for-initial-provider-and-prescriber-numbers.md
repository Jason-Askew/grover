# Apply for initial provider and prescriber numbers

Apply for an initial Medicare provider number or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) prescriber number.

Apply online

Some health professionals can apply online for their initial Medicare provider or prescriber number.

You need a [Provider Digital Access (PRODA)](/provider-digital-access-proda) account to access [Health Professional Online Services (HPOS)](/hpos?context=20). If you don’t have one, [register for PRODA online](/how-to-register-for-individual-proda-account). Then follow the steps to set up your HPOS access.

Find out how to [apply for a provider or prescriber number if you’re a medical intern](/medical-intern-application-for-provider-or-prescriber-number?context=20).

Apply for an initial Medicare provider number

To apply for an initial Medicare provider number, [log in](https://proda.humanservices.gov.au/prodalogin/pages/public/login.jsf) to your PRODA account to access HPOS, then:

1.  Select **My Details**.
2.  Select **My Digital Provider Number Registration**.
3.  Select **Apply.**
4.  Complete the questions in the application and select **submit.**

If you’re an allied health professional not registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) you can also apply online. You must be registered with a respective board or organisation.

If you don’t have an identifier that is recognised by us, you’ll be able to link to HPOS without providing any identifiers.

Learn more about [provider eligibility](https://hpe.servicesaustralia.gov.au/provider-eligibility.html) on the Health Professional Education website.

If you’re also applying for a PBS prescriber number

1.  Go to the **Location Details** section in the **Practice Address** Tab.
2.  Select **yes** to the question ‘Do you want a prescriber number for prescribing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines under the _National Health Act 1953_?’.

You can save your application and come back to it later if you need to.

If you’re only applying for a prescriber number

If you’re applying for a prescriber number separately, you need to complete a paper form:

-   [Application for a Medicare provider number and/or prescriber number for a medical practitioner form](/hw019?context=20)
-   [Application for a Medicare provider number and/or prescriber number for a midwife or nurse practitioner form](/hw088?context=20)
-   [Application for a Medicare provider number and/or prescriber number for allied health and non-medical health professionals form](/hw093?context=20).

If you can’t apply online

We process applications in order of receipt to apply procedural fairness for all applicants.
