# Single Touch Payroll for employers

We use details you report through Single Touch Payroll (STP) to help us deliver payments and services to your employees if they’re our customer.

When you report your employee’s payroll information to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) through STP, we get some of the information. This includes the total of each pay you report which we get as a year-to date figure, broken down into components. We then calculate the amount paid for the pay period by comparing the latest year-to-date figure with the previous year-to-date figure.

We may use this to pre-fill employment income details when the customer goes to report their income to us. This makes reporting the right information easier for them to complete.

We may also pre-fill your business name and ABN for current employees, or cessation details for previous employees, when they claim a payment from us.

Our customers are responsible for checking and accepting or changing calculated amounts or other details that pre-fill.

You can also report child support deductions and garnishee payments to us through STP.

You can find out more about [STP](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/hiring-and-paying-your-workers/single-touch-payroll) on the ATO website.
