## Who a grandparent carer is

Being a grandparent carer is more than helping parents with babysitting or school pick-ups, or providing care due to work, travel or study commitments. You’re a grandparent carer if you provide ongoing care and make the day-to-day decisions for your grandchildren.

Grandparents who are caring for children and live in the same house as a parent are generally not eligible for payments. If you’re in this situation, you can [contact us](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your circumstances.

A grandparent can be one of the following:

-   a biological, adoptive, step or great grandparent of the child
-   the current or former partner of a biological, adoptive or relationship grandparent or great grandparent
-   a parent or grandparent of a relationship parent of the child.

A relationship parent is a person who is legally responsible for a child born as a result of artificial conception procedures or under surrogacy arrangements.

We don’t consider any of the following to be grandparents for payments and services:

-   former partners of step grandparents
-   former partners of step great grandparents.

If you’re a non-parent carer, but aren’t a grandparent, you can read about [support for non-parent carers](/support-for-foster-carers-and-other-non-parent-carers).

## Payments and services to help grandparent carers

If you’re a grandparent carer, you may be able to get payments.

[Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit) helps with the costs of raising or caring for children. You may be eligible if you’re the carer of a child, including formal and informal foster children and grandchildren.

[Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy) helps with the cost of approved child care. You may be eligible if you have at least 14% care of the child and are responsible for paying child care fees for the child.

[Additional Child Care Subsidy Grandparent](/grandparent-additional-child-care-subsidy) gives grandparents extra assistance with the cost of approved child care. You’ll be able to access 100 hours of subsidised care each fortnight for your grandchild.

[Double Orphan Pension](/double-orphan-pension) helps with the costs of caring for children where any of the following apply:

-   their parents have both died
-   one parent has died and the other is in a psychiatric institution or nursing home for an indefinite time, in prison for at least 10 years or their whereabouts are unknown
-   they’re a refugee and both parents are living outside Australia or their whereabouts are unknown.

[Foster Child Health Care Card](/foster-child-health-care-card) helps you get cheaper medicines and some discounts for children in your care. You don’t need to be a formal foster carer to be eligible. You could be eligible if you care for a child who is not your or your partner’s biological or adopted child.

[Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme](/assistance-for-isolated-children-scheme) helps carers of school aged students if they either:

-   live in an isolated area
-   can’t go to an appropriate state school daily because they have disability or special health needs.

[Grandparent, Foster and Kinship Carer Advisers](/grandparent-foster-and-kinship-carer-advisers) help non-parent carers who provide ongoing care for children. Our advisers give tailored help if you’re a grandparent carer.

## What is needed to make a claim

When you claim a payment, we’ll ask you for certain documents or information. You need to provide these before you can submit your claim. This may include all of the following:

-   personal details such as tax file numbers for you and your partner, family income details, residence details and bank account details
-   child details including name and date of birth
-   proof of the birth or adoption, if not already established with us
-   details of the previous carer
-   details about the child’s care arrangements.

## Medicare services

A [Medicare card](/medicare-card) helps you with some health expenses, such as free doctor visits at health clinics.

[Australian Immunisation Register](/australian-immunisation-register) is a national register that records vaccinations.

[Child Dental Benefits Schedule](/child-dental-benefits-schedule) provides access to benefits for basic dental services for children.

[Medicare Safety Net](/medicare-safety-nets) can help to lower your out of pocket medical costs for out of hospital services.

[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Safety Net](/when-you-spend-lot-pbs-medicines) can reduce the cost of prescription medicines once the threshold has been reached.

## Child support for non-parent carers

If you care for a child and aren’t the parent, you may get child support from both parents. Find out about applying for [child support as a non-parent carer](/non-parent-carer-applying-for-child-support).

Any child support you receive may affect how much Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A you get. Read about [child support and your Family Tax Benefit Part A](/child-support-and-your-family-tax-benefit-part?context=60007).
