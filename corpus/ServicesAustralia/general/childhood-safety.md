Raising children can be hard. We know there’s a lot of things to think about when it comes to keeping your child safe.

## Make a safe environment

It’s important your child has a safe environment to grow and thrive.

### Safe parenting

While your child is growing, they don’t understand what is and isn’t safe for them. Supervision ensures your child stays safe.

Children need a safe and healthy environment. If you were raised a certain way by your parents, you may not realise some behaviours are harmful. Some behaviours may be abuse and neglect.

[ParentWorks](https://parentworks.org.au/) is a free online program for parents and caregivers of children aged 2 to 16. You can learn strategies to improve your parenting skills and confidence, and manage your child’s behaviour.

The Raising Children Network website has more information about keeping your child safe including:

-   help if [you feel you might hurt your child](https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/domestic-family-violence/when-you-might-hurt-your-child)
-   [child safety at home](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/safety/home-pets/home-safety), including practical suggestions to make your home safe
-   [CPR for children and teenagers](https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/safety/cpr-first-aid/cpr-for-children) in case there’s an emergency.
-   a list of [national and state parenting helplines](https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/services-support/about-services-support/helplines) you can call for advice or support.
