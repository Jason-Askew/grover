## Genuine digital concession cards

We've included security measures in the apps. This helps to make sure a customer’s digital concession card is genuine and valid. Customers need to sign in to the app, to show the card within the app.

To see your genuine card in the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app:

1.  Select **More** from the home screen.
2.  Select **Digital wallet**.
3.  Your card will show.
4.  Rotate your device to view the card in landscape orientation.
5.  Select **Front** or **Back** to show the front or back of the card.

If the concession card is no longer active, **EXPIRED** will appear on the screen. The customer can then reapply for a concession card.

You can learn more about digital cards in the [myGov app](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-app) on the myGov website.

A digital concession card doesn't replace the physical concession card. You should continue to accept physical concession cards from your customers when they're presented.

The customer might not be able to provide the digital or physical concession card. You can tell them to go to their local service centre to get a temporary card.
