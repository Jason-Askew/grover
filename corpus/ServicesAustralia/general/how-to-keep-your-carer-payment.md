-   [Changes to your care giving](#a2)
-   [Changes to your work](#a3)

When you’re getting Carer Payment from us, you need to tell us within 14 days about any personal, income or care changes.

## Changes to your personal circumstances

It’s important to keep us up to date with your personal circumstances. This includes things like where you live, your relationship status, what you get paid and any changes to your assets.

Read more about what you need to tell us if there are [changes to your circumstances](/change-circumstances-while-getting-carer-payment?context=21816).

## Changes to your care giving

We need to know if there are changes to your caring arrangements. This could be any of the following:

-   you take a [break from caring](/breaks-from-caring-when-you-get-carer-payment?context=21816)
-   you or the person you care for are [going overseas](/travel-outside-australia-rules-for-carer-payment?context=21816)
-   your care receiver moves to an aged care home or residential care
-   you’ve stopped caring or started caring for another person.

To check who you’re getting a payment for, go to **My Payments** in your Centrelink online account.

Please tell us about any changes within 14 days.

## Changes to your work

You may still get Carer Payment if you do paid work or are self-employed for up to 100 hours in a 4 week period. Read more about [working while getting Carer Payment](/working-while-you-get-carer-payment?context=21816).

It’s important you tell us if you start or stop working, if the amount you get paid or the hours you spend working changes. The amount of Carer Payment may change depending on how much you get paid. So we pay you the right amount you’ll need to report your income and the hours you spent working each fortnight. You will need to confirm the hours you have worked for all employers listed, even if it is zero.

Learn more about reporting employment income and the hours you’ve worked in our [online guide](/centrelink-online-account-help-report-employment-income-carers).

If you’re working, you may get [Working Credit](/working-credit?context=21816). It increases how much you can earn before we start reducing your payments.
