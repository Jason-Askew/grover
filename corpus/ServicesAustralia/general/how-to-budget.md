## Getting started

A budget is a financial plan to help you manage your money. By looking at money coming in and going out, you can use your money where it matters most. A budget lets you find ways to spend less and save more to achieve your money goals.

### Review or make your budget

Work out how much money you have coming in by using any of these:

-   pay slips
-   bank statements
-   [Centrelink Deduction Statements](/keep-track-your-centrepay-deductions?context=60271).

Work out how much you’re spending. To do this, look at any of these:

-   bills
-   bank statements including direct debits
-   credit card statements
-   receipts and shopping dockets
-   annual and one-off costs, like insurance and car registration
-   [Centrelink Deduction Statements](/keep-track-your-centrepay-deductions?context=60271)[.](/keep-track-your-centrepay-deductions?context=60271)

You can then see if you have money left over that you could use for your savings. You don’t need to have a big savings goal. Small goals are just as good, like saving for school supplies or furniture. Setting a savings goal means you’ll know how much you need to save regularly to reach your goal. We have information to help you [know how to build savings](/how-to-build-savings?context=60271).

Remember to review your budget often to make sure it’s still working for you. A change in your income or costs can impact your budget.

You can use the simple money manager to review or make your budget. It’s available in 9 languages and has audio content to describe each section.
