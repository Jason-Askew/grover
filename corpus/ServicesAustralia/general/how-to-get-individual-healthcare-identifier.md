# How to get an IHI

Find out how to get an Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI).

## on this page

-   [Get an IHI online](#a1)
-   [Get an IHI using a form](#a2)
-   [Get an IHI under a different name](#a3)

You already have an IHI if any of the following apply:

-   you have a Medicare card
-   you have a DVA card
-   you’re enrolled in Medicare.

If you don’t have an IHI, you can get one either online or using a form. You must be in Australia when you apply so we can verify your identity.

## Get an IHI online

The quickest way to get an IHI is online through your [myGov account](https://my.gov.au/). If you don’t have an account, it’s easy to [create one](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/create-mygov-account) on the myGov website.

You’ll need one of the following identification documents:

-   your passport, with a valid Australian Visa
-   your Australian driver licence.

We’ll use these documents to verify your identity and give you an IHI.

Follow these steps to get an IHI online:

1.  Sign in to [myGov](https://my.gov.au/)
2.  Select services or link your first service.
3.  Select IHI service from the list
4.  Follow the prompts to get your IHI, and link the service.

## Get an IHI using a form

If you don’t have identification documents, you can get an IHI using the [Request an Individual Healthcare Identifier form](/ms003). If you fill in a form, it will take you longer to get an IHI, compared to getting one online.

You’ll need to provide other acceptable identity documents with your request. You must be in Australia when you apply so we can verify your identity.

## Get an IHI under a different name

If you’re concerned about using your real name, you can use a different name or pseudonym to register for an IHI. You’ll need an existing IHI before you can request an IHI in a pseudonym name.

To do this, complete the [Request or merge a pseudonym Individual Healthcare Identifier record form](/ms005).

You won’t be eligible to claim Medicare or PBS medicines under your pseudonym.
