# Teenage years

Find out how payments and services for you or your child change as they get older.

The age of your child affects your eligibility for:

-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit)
-   [Child Care Subsidy](/child-care-subsidy).

It also impacts their ability to claim payments and access services in their own right.

If you’re the parent of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander student or apprentice, you can claim [ABSTUDY](/abstudy). We pay it for children in both primary and secondary study.

The [Child Dental Benefits Schedule](/child-dental-benefits-schedule) covers part or the full cost of some basic dental services for eligible children and teenagers aged 0 to 17 years old.
