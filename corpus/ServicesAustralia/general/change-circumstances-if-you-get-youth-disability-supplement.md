# Change of circumstances

You must tell us about changes that may affect your payment within 14 days of the change.

## on this page

-   [How to tell us](#a1)
-   [What happens if you don’t tell us](#a2)

For example, you need to tell us if:

-   you [change or correct your name](#changename)
-   your income changes
-   you start working
-   you change address
-   you go overseas.

## How to tell us

You can tell us about changes at any time either:

-   [online](/self-service)
-   by [phone self service](/centrelink-phone-self-service).

### Changing or correcting your name

It’s important to tell us if you [change your legal name](/how-to-update-your-name-with-centrelink).

## What happens if you don’t tell us

If you don’t tell us about changes, we may pay you too much. If this happens you’ll have to [pay the money back](/how-to-repay-money-you-owe-to-centrelink).

If you deliberately don’t tell us about changes, we could charge you with [fraud](/report-fraud).

If you give us the wrong details about your work income, you may have to pay a recovery fee.
