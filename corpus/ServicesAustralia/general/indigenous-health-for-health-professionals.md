# Indigenous health for health professionals

Health professionals delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can access various payments and programs.

The Indigenous Access Program connects Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians with our services, including health assessments.

The Remote Area Aboriginal Health Services Program allows health professionals to order and claim eligible Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) medicines provided for free to patients in remote areas.

The Closing the Gap PBS co-payment reduces the cost of PBS medicines for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.

Health professionals can complete and claim for health assessments and follow-up services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients.

Chronic Condition Management (CCM) services help health professionals care for Indigenous patients with a chronic or terminal condition.
