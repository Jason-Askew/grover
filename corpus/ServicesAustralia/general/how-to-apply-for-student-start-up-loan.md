# How to apply

You can apply for the Student Start-up Loan if you're claiming or already getting a student payment.

If you’re claiming any of the following student payments you can apply for the Student Start-up Loan during your claim:

-   Youth Allowance
-   Austudy
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance.

If you’re already getting a student payment for [a loan approved course](/student-start-up-loan-approved-courses?context=23316), and your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  From the menu select **Payments and claims**, then **Update Circumstances**.
3.  Select **Apply for/Manage Student Start-up Loan** then follow the prompts to complete your application.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

If you’re not eligible for the Student Start-up Loan you won’t have the option to apply in your online account.

If you don’t agree with a decision we make about your application for a Student Start-up Loan, you can ask us for an [explanation or a review of our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews?context=64107).
