# How to use

Find out how to get dental services using the Child Dental Benefits Schedule (CDBS).

You can get child dental benefits for services at most dentists. Don’t forget you can only claim benefits for any of the following:

-   up to $1,132 for each eligible child if 2025 is year one of the [2 calendar year period](/whats-covered-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426#2year)
-   up to $1,158 for each eligible child if 2026 is year one of the [2 calendar year period](/whats-covered-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426#2year)
-   the types of [services we cover](/whats-covered-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426).

The cap amount is indexed yearly on 1 January. The increase in cap amount will only apply to a child or teenager who gets their first eligible service in that year.

## Before going to the dentist

When you book an appointment, say you want to use CDBS. Check how close you are to the balance cap limit. This will tell you what benefit amount you can get.

If your Medicare online account is linked to myGov, you can check your CDBS balance online.

To do this:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **History and statements**, then **Child Dental Benefits Schedule**.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www2.medicareaustralia.gov.au/moasso/sps/oidc/rp/moa/kickoff/mygov?target_link_uri=%2Fmoaonline)

You can also call the [Medicare program line](#toolbar-phone).

You don’t have to take your CDBS eligibility letter to the dentist. They’ll check your child’s eligibility and available benefit amount at the appointment.

### At the dentist

At the appointment, ask about both of these:

-   what each service will cost
-   if CDBS will cover the services.

You’ll get a consent form. This says you agree to the services and what they cost. Check these, then sign if you agree.

Some dentists give you a bill to pay on the day of the service. You can then [claim a benefit](/how-to-claim-child-dental-benefits-schedule?context=22426) from us. You can often do this at the dentist straight after you pay.

If the dentist [bulk bills](/bulk-billing) you don’t need to pay or claim.
