# Your home conditions are unsuitable

You may get a higher rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance if you live away from home because of your home conditions.

You may get it if conditions at home or in the community seriously affect your ability to either:

-   study
-   do your apprenticeship.

Things that might seriously affect your ability include:

-   you often lack basic needs such as food, water, clothing, power, shelter or sleep
-   drug or alcohol abuse, criminal or illegal activity, or violence in the home seriously threaten your health and wellbeing
-   noise, overcrowding, chronic illness or lack of facilities prevent or disrupt your study at home.
