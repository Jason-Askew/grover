## Patient eligibility

The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidises treatment with avatrombopag, eltrombopag and romiplostim under the _National Health Act 1953_, section 100 for patients with ITP.

Patients must be eligible for the [PBS](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme) and meet the relevant restriction criteria.

The [Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits](https://www.pbs.gov.au/pbs/home;jsessionid=jrrab7f28xtjycras12yiccu) on the PBS website outlines the restrictions for prescribing avatrombopag, eltrombopag and romiplostim.

## Section 100 arrangements

### Avatrombopag, eltrombopag and romiplostim

These items are only PBS-subsidised for non-admitted patients, day admitted patients, or patients on discharge who are attending:

-   an approved private hospital
-   a public hospital.

These items aren’t PBS-subsidised for public hospital in-patients. You must include the hospital name and provider number on the authority application form.

## Treatment specifics

For romiplostim initial treatment, you need to request one vial of the appropriate strength, to titrate therapy based on the patient’s weight. A maximum of 5 repeats will be authorised.

Once the patient’s dose has been stable for a period of 4 weeks, you can request authority approval under the balance of supply or change of therapy restriction for sufficient vials of appropriate strength. This will be based on the patient’s weight and dose (mcg/kg/week) for up to 4 weeks of treatment. The total period of treatment authorised under this restriction must not exceed 24 weeks and authority approval won’t be given for doses higher than 10 mcg/kg/week.

Where a patient has started treatment with avatrombopag, eltrombopag or romiplostim, you can authorise a change of therapy to an alternative agent at any time under the balance of supply or change of therapy restriction.
