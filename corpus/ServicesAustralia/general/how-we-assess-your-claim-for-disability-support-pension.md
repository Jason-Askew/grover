# How we assess your claim

When you claim Disability Support Pension (DSP), we assess if you meet both non-medical and medical rules.

You must continue to meet all the non-medical and medical rules. Remember to let us know if any of your [circumstances change](/change-circumstances-while-receiving-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

## Steps in assessing your claim

### 1\. We assess non-medical rules

We review the information you give us with your claim to check if you meet [non-medical rules](/non-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276). This includes your financial situation, residence rules and age.

If you don’t meet all non-medical rules you can’t get DSP. You may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

### 2\. We assess manifest medical rules

We review the [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you give us with your claim to check if you meet the [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

We may talk to your treating doctors and other health professionals about your [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

If you meet [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276), there is no further medical assessment.

If you don’t meet [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276), we’ll check if you meet [general medical rules](/general-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

### 3\. We assess general medical rules

We review the [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) you give us in your claim to check if you meet the [general medical rules](/general-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276). We’ll do this if you don’t meet [manifest medical rules](/manifest-medical-rules-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

We assess if your condition is [diagnosed, reasonably treated and stabilised](/diagnosed-reasonably-treated-and-stabilised-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and unlikely to improve with further treatment.

We check if the impact of your condition:

-   is likely to persist for more than 2 years
-   rates at least 20 points on the [Impairment](/impairment-rating-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) Tables
-   will stop you [working](/assessing-your-ability-to-work-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) at least 15 hours a week in the next 2 years, even with training.

We also check if you meet [Program of Support](/program-support-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) rules, if these apply to you.

We may ask you to go to both a [Job Capacity Assessment](/job-capacity-assessment-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and [Disability Medical Assessment](/disability-medical-assessment-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276). If you have any new evidence, you haven’t already given us, you can bring it to these appointments.

We may talk to your treating doctors and other health professionals about your [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

If you don’t meet either the manifest or general medical rules, you’re not medically eligible. This means you can’t get DSP. You may be able to get [other payments](/other-payments-if-you-cant-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

### 4\. We let you know the result of your claim

We assess if you can get DSP and let you know the result of your claim. We'll send a letter to [explain our decision](/explaining-decision-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) to your preferred type of communication. This could be one of the following:

-   [myGov Inbox](/centrelink-letters-online)
-   [Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account)
-   [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   a letter in the mail.

If you don’t meet all the medical and non-medical rules we’ll reject your claim. If we reject your claim, we will try to call you to explain why. We’ll also write to you. You need to [keep your contact details](/self-service) up to date so we can contact you.

One of our Service Officers will call you to explain:

-   the reason for our decision
-   your options if you don’t agree with our decision.

We can also provide referrals to other services such as [Inclusive Employment Australia](/inclusive-employment-australia?context=22276) if you’re eligible. Find out about [Inclusive Employment Australia](https://www.dss.gov.au/inclusive-employment-australia) on the Department of Social Services website.

If you are still unsure, you can contact us to ask for more information about our assessment, including both:

-   a copy of your medical assessment
-   why you don’t meet DSP eligibility.

If you think we’ve made a mistake you can ask us to [review our decision](/explanations-and-formal-reviews).

If your situation changes, and you think you may now be eligible for DSP, you can submit a new claim. Read about [who can get it](/who-can-get-disability-support-pension?context=22276) and what to do before [claiming DSP again](/claiming-again-disability-support-pension?context=22276).

If you get DSP, you’ll need to meet your obligations to keep getting the payment. Read more about [how to manage your payment](/how-to-manage-your-payment-disability-support-pension?context=22276).
