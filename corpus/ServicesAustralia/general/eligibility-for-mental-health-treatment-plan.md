# Eligibility for a mental health treatment plan

Rules about patient eligibility for a Mental Health Treatment Plan (MHTP) under Better Access.

## Patient eligibility

MHTP services under the Better Access initiative are available to eligible:

-   patients in the community
-   private in-patients, including residents of a Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) being discharged from hospital.

Eligible patients can claim a Medicare benefit for up to 10 individual and 10 group therapy mental health treatment services each calendar year if they have a MHTP and a valid referral.

To be eligible, a patient must:

-   have a clinically diagnosed mental disorder
-   require a moderate level of support
-   be likely to benefit from a structured approach to the management of their care needs
-   see their usual medical practitioner or a GP or PMP at the general practice they are enrolled in for MyMedicare

A patient’s treatment may also include either or all:

-   GP chronic condition management plan (GPCCMP)
-   Eating Disorder Treatment and Management Plan (EDTMP)
-   Mental Health Case Conferences (MHCC).

All require involvement of a multidisciplinary team.

You can use the [Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items online checker in HPOS](/check-mbs-item-numbers?context=20) to confirm patient and claim eligibility. Learn about the relevant MBS item descriptions, fact sheets and explanatory notes on the [MBS Online](http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/) website.
