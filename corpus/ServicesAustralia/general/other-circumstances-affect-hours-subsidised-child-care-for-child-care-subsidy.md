# Other circumstances that affect hours of subsidised child care

The number of hours of subsidised child care you can get depends on your circumstances.

You can get 100 hours of subsidised child care if you meet one of the following. You:

-   are temporarily outside Australia for up to a maximum of 6 weeks
-   have disability or medical condition that stops you from engaging in recognised participation
-   get [Carer Payment](/carer-payment) or would get Carer Payment except for the income or asset test
-   are in prison or psychiatric confinement in relation to an offence.

There are other situations where you can get 100 hours of subsidised child care.

When you’re a Grandparent

If you or your partner have 65% or more care of a grandchild or great grandchild, you can get 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight for your grandchild or great-grandchild.

When you get Additional Child Care Subsidy Child Wellbeing

If a child in your care got [Additional Child Care Subsidy Child Wellbeing](/child-wellbeing-subsidy?context=41866) for a continuous period of 6 months or more, and is no longer eligible, you may be entitled to 100 hours of subsidised care for them for 18 months from the date their Additional Child Care Subsidy payment stops.

We assess this on a case by case basis. Please call the [Families line](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your circumstances.

When you experience exceptional circumstances

This is when you face circumstances that impact your ability to either:

-   engage in recognised participation
-   care for your child.

For example, you may be exempt from recognised participation if you’re affected by [family and domestic violence](/family-and-domestic-violence) or experiencing serious illness.

We assess all exceptional circumstances on a case by case basis. Please call the [Families line](#toolbar-phone) to discuss your circumstances.
