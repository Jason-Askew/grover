## Indigenous Australians

If you have [standard identity documents](/how-to-prove-your-identity-with-centrelink), mail or email them with your [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004) to [Medicare Enrolment Services](/write-to-us#medicare). You can also [enrol online through](#enrolonline) myGov.

If you don’t have standard identity documents, you can use a referee instead. You and your referee need to fill in the [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Medicare enrolment and amendment form](/ms018?context=60092). The form says who can be a referee.

You can mail, email or take your form to your local agent or [access point or service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/). You can also call the [Indigenous Access Line](#toolbar-phone) if you need help with the form.

## How to enrol

You can enrol in Medicare either:

-   online through myGov
-   by completing a Medicare enrolment form.

### Enrolling online

You can enrol online in Medicare as either an individual or a family through myGov and track the progress.

To enrol online you and your family members need to:

-   live in Australia
-   have a current passport or ImmiCard
-   have visa details from the Department of Home Affairs.

If you want to enrol as a family, we need details and identity documents for any children under 15.

If you want to include someone 15 or older, you need to give that person your application number.

They need the number to give us their details and identity documents through their own myGov account to complete their Medicare enrolment.

If you have a myGov account sign in and enrol in Medicare. If you don’t have a myGov account you need to [create one](/create-online-account).

[Sign in to myGov](https://my.gov.au/)

If your application is approved, we’ll contact you with your next steps. We’ll also send you your [Medicare card](/your-medicare-card?context=60092) in the mail to the address you gave us.

### Enrolling with a form

If you can’t enrol online, complete a [Medicare enrolment form](/ms004). You can mail or email it with your supporting documents to [Medicare Enrolment Services](/write-to-us#medicare).

If you email us, include ‘Medicare enrolment’ in the email subject line.

Make sure your documents are:

-   in PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format
-   not password protected, or in a WinZip or RAR file
-   no larger than 5MB for each document
