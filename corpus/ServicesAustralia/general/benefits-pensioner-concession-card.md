# Benefits of the card

With a Pensioner Concession Card (PCC) you can get cheaper medicine, bulk billed doctor visits and help with hearing services.

With your card you can get:

-   cheaper medicine under the [Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme](/pharmaceutical-benefits-scheme)
-   bulk billed doctor visits, which will depend on your doctor if you are eligible for these
-   a bigger refund for medical costs when you reach the [Medicare Safety Net](/medicare-safety-nets)
-   help with hearing services, such as the [Hearing Services Program](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/hearing-services-program) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website
-   discounts to redirect your mail through Australia Post.

Your dependent child may also be able to get some of these benefits.

## Other benefits

Some state and territory governments and local council areas offer other benefits if you have a Pensioner Concession Card. Check with your local area to see what benefits they offer. For example they may offer lower rates for these types of expenses:

-   electricity and gas bills
-   property and water rates
-   healthcare costs, including ambulance, dental and eye care
-   public transport fares
-   motor vehicle registration.
