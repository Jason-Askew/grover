## Beware of scams

Beware of scammers pretending to be us on social media. They may contact you via direct message, ask you to join a live chat, or post messages in a private social media group. They’ll also ask for your personal information. We’ll never do these things online as they aren’t secure ways to share information. If the account isn’t listed on this page, then it isn’t us.
