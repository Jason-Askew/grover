# Medical reviews

If you’re getting Carer Allowance, we may do a medical review of the person you care for from time to time.

## on this page

-   [If you provide care for a child aged under 16](#a1)
-   [If you provide care for someone aged 16 or older](#a2)

If you’re getting Carer Allowance, we may do a medical review of the person you provide care for. This is so we can check for any changes to:

-   the amount and level of care you provide
-   the disability or medical condition of the person you care for.

We’ll send you the forms in the post. The forms need to be completed by you and the health professional treating the person you care for. You’ll need to return the forms to us, using the information on the form.

If we don’t get the forms back from you, we might call you. It’s important to keep your personal details up to date. Read more about telling us about a [change in circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-carer-allowance?context=21811).

## If you provide care for a child aged under 16

We may do a medical review when the child will be turning the following ages:

-   4 years and 8 months old
-   10 years old
-   13 years old.

We send you the forms before the child reaches these ages.

We’ll review the child’s care needs under the Disability Care Load Assessment (Child) Determination 2020 (DCLAD).

If you get Carer Allowance for a child who has been continuously hospitalised, we’ll do a review every 12 weeks for the first 2 years. If the child’s still in hospital after 2 years, we’ll do a medical review every 12 months.

## If you provide care for someone aged 16 or older

We may ask for a full review including a medical assessment.

We’ll review the person’s care needs and medical assessment using the Adult Disability Assessment Determination (ADAT).
