# To end a limited child support agreement

You or the other parent can end a limited agreement.

## on this page

-   [If your care arrangements change](#a1)
-   [If an agreement is ended or suspended](#a2)

You or the other parent can end a limited agreement if:

-   both of you agree in writing to end the agreement
-   you make a new limited or binding agreement that reflects new arrangements
-   it was made over 3 years ago, and a parent asks to end it in writing.

You or the other parent can also end it if the notional assessment varies. For example, it varies by more than 15% from the previous one because of circumstances not included in the agreement.

Either parent can also ask to end a limited agreement in writing.

A court may also make an order that sets aside the agreement.

## If your care arrangements change

Changes to the care arrangements can affect a child support assessment. You need to tell us about changes straight away. If you don’t tell us within 28 days any of the following may happen:

-   your level of care may only apply from the date you tell us
-   you may get a child support debt or overpayment
-   your assessment may be suspended or ended.

Find out more about [how to tell us if your child’s care arrangements change](/child-support-payments-and-care-arrangements?context=21911#howtotellus).

Child support won’t be paid to a parent under an agreement if they have less than 35% care.

We’ll end or suspend a child support agreement for a child when both of the following apply:

-   the receiving parent under the agreement has less than [35% care](/how-your-percentage-care-affects-your-family-tax-benefit-ftb-payments)
-   the other parent has at least 35 per cent care of the child.

An agreement may be suspended after a care change for either:

-   28 days
-   up to 26 weeks.

The length of the suspension will depend on your circumstances. For example, your limited agreement may say that it will be suspended for 26 weeks if care changes.

If care changes back during the suspension period, the agreement will restart. If the parent still doesn’t have care at the end of the suspension period, that child’s agreement will end.

## If an agreement is ended or suspended

Child support will still be payable for the child under your formula based assessment.

If we suspend or end your agreement, we’ll tell you how this will affect you.
