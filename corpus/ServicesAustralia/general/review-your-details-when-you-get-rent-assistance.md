# Review of your rent details

We may review your rent details to check they're up to date.

We may ask you to review and confirm, or update your rent details. This is to make sure you’re getting the right amount of Rent Assistance.

If this applies to you, we’ll send you a letter. If you get letters online, check your myGov Inbox and your Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

If you and your partner both get a review letter, just 1 of you needs to reply.

## Why we sent you a letter

We send letters to make sure we have up to date records, such as:

-   how much rent you pay
-   if you’re still living at the same address.

Our letter asks you to review and confirm your rent details. You should also update any details that are no longer correct. If you get letters electronically, we’ll send them to your myGov Inbox and your Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

## What you need to do

You must complete your Rent Assistance review by the due date in the letter.

### Completing your Rent Assistance review

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can complete your review online.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account, you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account?context=64107).

You can also complete your review by:

-   using the [Express Plus Centrelink app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app)
-   using phone [self service](/contact-us#selfservice)
-   calling the dedicated phone number in your letter.

### Completing a Rent Certificate form

We may send you a Rent Certificate form to confirm your details. You must sign the certificate and return it by the due date. If you don’t your Rent Assistance will stop.

You need to send us a copy of your lease or tenancy agreement with the completed form.

#### If you don’t have a lease or tenancy agreement

Your landlord needs to sign the Rent Certificate form to verify details are correct.

### Submitting the form

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, sign in now to submit the form.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

You can also use the [Express Plus Centrelink mobile app](/express-plus-centrelink-mobile-app).

Use the [submit documents with your Centrelink online account](/centrelink-online-account-help-upload-documents) guide to help you.

You can also either:

-   send it to:
    
    Services Australia  
    Reply Paid 7800  
    Canberra ACT 2610
    
-   drop it in to a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

## What happens if you don’t do the review

If you don’t complete your review by the due date, we’ll stop your Rent Assistance.

Your Rent Assistance will start again if you complete your review and you’re still eligible.

You’ll need to reclaim Rent Assistance if it’s been over 28 days since the due date on your letter. You can do this by either:

-   [calling](/phone-us) your usual payment line
-   visiting a [service centre](https://findus.servicesaustralia.gov.au/).

## What happens next

We use the information you give us to check your details. We do this to make sure you’re getting the right payment amount.

The review could mean any of the following:

-   your payment changes to be more or less than you get now
-   you’re no longer eligible for Rent Assistance
-   you need to pay back money because of overpayment
-   your payment stays the same.

## What to do if you don’t agree with our decision

If you don’t agree with our decision you can [ask us for a review](/explanations-and-formal-reviews-centrelink-decision?context=26266). There’s no time limit to request a review of your debt. You can also ask us to pause your debt repayments while we carry out the review.

### Your payment amount changes

If you don’t agree with the new payment amount you can ask us to review our decision. You need to contact us within 13 weeks from when we tell you your new Rent Assistance amount.

### We’ve overpaid you and you now owe us money

If you don’t understand how we’ve overpaid you, we can explain. Call the number on your letter and we’ll give you a full explanation.

## What help is available

You can call the number on your letter if you have any questions.

You can also call our:

-   [Multilingual Phone Service](/phone-us#languages) to speak to us in your language
-   [Indigenous Call Centre](/phone-us#indigenousaustralians) if you identify as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Australian.
