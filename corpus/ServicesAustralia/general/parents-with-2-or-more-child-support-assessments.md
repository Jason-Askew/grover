# Parents with 2 or more assessments

We work out how much child support you pay or receive if you have 2 or more families from past relationships

The calculations for parents with 2 or more child support assessments are a little more involved. To work out your child support income if you pay or receive child support for 2 or more families from previous relationships, we apply the formula to your adjusted taxable income after we deduct all of the following:

-   a multi-case allowance for supporting your children in other child support cases
-   the self support amount
-   any relevant dependent child amount.

We work out the multi-case allowance for each child according to their age and how much it would cost if all the children were living with you.

Where a paying parent has multiple cases, the formula uses a multi-case cap to determine the maximum amount of child support payable. The multi-case cap ensures you do not pay more in child support than it would cost if you had all your children that need child support payments living with you.
