# Medical reviews

If you’re getting Disability Support Pension (DSP), we may do a review to check you still meet medical rules.

## Why we conduct reviews

We do medical reviews for a range of reasons.

If you’ve been on DSP for a while, we may need to check both of the following:

-   we’ve got current details about the impact of your disability or medical condition
-   you meet the current medical rules for DSP.

The rules for DSP have changed over time.

Read more about the [Impairment Tables](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers-benefits-payments/impairment-tables-for-disability-support-pension) on the Department of Social Services (DSS) website. They also have an easy read guide that you can download or listen to.

## When we’ll contact you

If you’re selected for a medical review, we’ll write to you to let you know:

-   the review date
-   what you’ll need to do.

You’ll need to give us information for the review. This may include:

-   a review form with a report from your treating health professional
-   current [medical evidence](/medical-evidence-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276) for your condition.

We may also need to contact your treating health professional. You can help by completing the [consent to disclose medical information form](/sa472). It confirms you consent to your health professional disclosing relevant information to us about your medical conditions.

[Call us](#toolbar-phone) before your review date if you:

-   need help filling out the review form
-   are having trouble getting current medical evidence
-   won’t be able to return the review form or current medical evidence by the due date
-   aren’t sure what information you need to give us.

We may give you more time to give us these details.

Your payment may stop if you don’t either give us the information or contact us to discuss it.

## What happens at the review

We may ask you to attend a [Job Capacity Assessment](/job-capacity-assessment-for-disability-support-pension?context=22276). This includes assessment of your conditions under the current Impairment Tables.

This helps us understand all of the following:

-   how your condition affects you now
-   your ability to work
-   any help you may need to get a job.

## What happens after the review

We’ll write to you with the outcome of your review.

If you’re no longer eligible for DSP, you may be able to get other support. You can use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what support may be suitable for you.
