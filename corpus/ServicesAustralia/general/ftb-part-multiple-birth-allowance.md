This payment is for people who get FTB Part A and are expecting or have had a multiple birth of triplets, quadruplets or more.

Multiple Birth Allowance is not for people who have twins in their care.

## Who can get it

You may be eligible for Multiple Birth Allowance if you get FTB Part A and you care for any of the following:

-   triplets
-   quadruplets or more.

## How much you can get

We’ll pay you $196.56 a fortnight for triplets or $261.94 a fortnight for quadruplets or more. We’ll assess you for this when you claim FTB. You don’t need to submit a separate claim for it.

## How we pay it

We’ll pay you Multiple Birth Allowance the same way you [choose to get your FTB](/payment-choices-for-ftb?context=22151).

You can choose to get all, part or none of your payment fortnightly. We’ll then pay any other FTB you’re entitled to and Multiple Birth Allowance when we [balance your payments](/balancing-family-tax-benefit?context=22151). We do this after the end of the financial year.
