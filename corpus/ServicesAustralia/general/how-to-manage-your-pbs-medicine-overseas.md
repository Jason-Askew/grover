# How to manage your PBS medicine overseas

There are laws and restrictions on the amount and types of PBS medicine you can take or send overseas.

It’s illegal to take Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidised medicines overseas for someone other than yourself or someone you’re travelling with. This includes immediate family members or relatives.

If you illegally take or send PBS-subsidised medicines overseas, you risk one or both of these:

-   a fine of up to $11,000 as of August 2021
-   2 years in prison.

If you need more information, call the [PBS taking or sending medicine overseas line](#toolbar-phone). We can help translate this information in another language. Let us know if you need an interpreter and we’ll arrange one for free.

## Before you go

Before you travel you should do all of these:

-   Check with the country’s embassy, high commission or consulate if the medicine is legal there.
-   If it’s legal in the country, ask your doctor for a letter that lists your medicines, including the strength and daily dosage. Take the letter with you when you travel. If you can’t do this, print and fill in the [Medicine Export Declaration form](/pb302). Take it with you when you go through customs.
-   Leave the medicine in the original packaging.

Find out more about [embassies, high commissions or consulates](https://www.dfat.gov.au/about-us/foreign-embassies/pages/foreign-embassies-and-consulates-in-australia) on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.

If you have concerns about any medicine you plan to take with you overseas, check the [SmartTraveller](https://smartraveller.gov.au/) website. You can search for the country you’re visiting and check what it says about medication under ‘Health’.
