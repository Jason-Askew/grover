There are things you can do throughout the financial year to help get the right payments and reduce your chance of getting a debt at tax time.

Most updates can be completed using your Centrelink online account through myGov or the Express Plus Centrelink mobile app.

## Arrange deductions from your payment for tax

If you get a Centrelink payment you can ask to have tax deducted from eligible taxable payments to reduce the risk of getting a tax bill. Find out how to [deduct tax from your payments](/deduct-tax-from-your-payment).

## Update your family income estimate

If you get Child Care Subsidy (CCS) or Family Tax Benefit (FTB) make sure your [family income estimate](/your-family-income-estimate-for-family-assistance-payments?context=22151) is always up to date, you can do this any time it changes during the year.

## Update your CCS withholdings

To reduce your chance of getting an overpayment or debt we withhold a percentage of your CCS until the end of the financial year. Find out more about how you can change your [withholding percentage for Child Care Subsidy](/centrelink-online-account-help-change-your-withholding-percentage-for-child-care-subsidy).

## Update your child support income or estimate if you pay or receive child support

If you pay or receive child support make sure all your child support details are right, including care arrangements, and update your income or child support [income estimate](/what-to-do-tax-time-if-you-pay-or-receive-child-support). Find out how to [manage your child support](/managing-child-support).

## Update your income and asset details

If you get a payment or allowance from Centrelink, you need to tell us when your circumstances change. Find out about [changing your circumstances with Centrelink](/change-circumstances-if-you-get-centrelink-payment).

## Keep a record if you got a disaster payment

If you got a taxable disaster payment during the year, keep a record of how much you got. Some payments won’t show on your payment summary. Find out more [about payments that don’t show on your payment summary](/payments-dont-show-your-payment-summary).
