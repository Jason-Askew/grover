## Submitting a claim for Parenting Payment

[Parenting Payment](/parenting-payment) is income support you may be able to get while you’re a young child’s [principal carer](/principal-carer-rules-for-parenting-payment).

You can [submit a claim](/how-to-claim-parenting-payment?context=22196) after your baby is born or when a child comes in to your care.

## Contacting us about child support

If you or your partner have a current child support assessment, you may be able to add your newborn child. We’ll add your baby to the assessment as a relevant dependent child. We can add the child to the assessment only after you tell Child Support about your newborn child.

We can help you [learn about child support](/learning-about-child-support?context=60015). This includes deciding on the type of child support arrangement that's right for you.
