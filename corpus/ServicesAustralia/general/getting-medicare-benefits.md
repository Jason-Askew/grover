For help with Medicare, you can call the [Medicare program line](/phone-us#medicaregeneral). Let us know if you need an interpreter and we'll arrange one for free.

We pay Medicare benefits to you using Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). To pay you, we need your current bank details. We can’t pay you with a cheque or cash.

## Getting started - how to set up a myGov account

To get started, you need a Medicare account linked to myGov.

Once you create a myGov account you will need to link your Medicare account. To do this follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to myGov.
2.  Select **View and link services**.
3.  Select **Link** on the Medicare tile.
4.  If your details are already recorded in myGov, they need to match your Medicare record. Select **Continue**. If you’re linking Medicare for the first time you’ll need to agree to myGov storing your personal details. Select **I agree**.
5.  You can link Medicare using your Medicare card details or [a linking code](https://my.gov.au/en/about/help/mygov-website/link-services-to-your-account/use-a-linking-code). Select the best option for you, then select **Next**.
