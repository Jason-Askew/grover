# Your local government school has a limited program or facilities

You may get a higher rate of ABSTUDY if your local government secondary schools are limited program schools. You must also live away from home to study because of this.

A limited program school is a school that either doesn’t:

-   offer all year levels or grades
-   have facilities or programs for you to get your Year 12 certificate or an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank.

State and territory education departments review limited program schools each year.

Check if there are limited program schools in your state or territory.
