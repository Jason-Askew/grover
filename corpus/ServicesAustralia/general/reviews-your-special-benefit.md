We’ve changed the way we review Special Benefit.

## What it means if we haven’t sent you a Special Benefit review

If we haven’t sent you a Special Benefit review, you won’t get one and you don’t need to do anything. We’ll let you know if we need any information from you.

You don’t need to contact us unless you’ve had a [change of circumstances](/change-circumstances-when-you-get-special-benefit?context=22281).

We may also select you at random to review your and your partner’s payment details as part of our [Payment Accuracy Reviews](/payment-accuracy-reviews).

## What to do if we’ve sent you a Special Benefit review

If we’ve already sent you a Special Benefit review, you need to complete it.

## How we review

If we’ve sent you a Special Benefit review, you can do it either:

-   online
-   by post.

### Online

If your Centrelink online account is linked to myGov, you can complete your review online. To do this, sign in to myGov and select **Special Benefit Review** from the **Tasks and Reminders** section.

[Sign in to myGov](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/sso/sps/oidc/rp/clkcust/kickoff/mygov?return_uri=https://my.gov.au/en/myaccount/dashboard&Target=/apps/custonline_entry/online-services)

If you don’t have a myGov account or a Centrelink online account, you’ll need to [create them](/create-online-account).

You must submit your review with all supporting documents by the due date or your payment may stop.

You might want to give your partner permission to make enquiries about your Special Benefit. You can do this in your Centrelink online account. This lets you both enter the information we need for you to complete your online review.

### Post

If you don’t have a myGov or Centrelink online account, we’ll send you a Special Benefit review form by post. If you have a nominee, we’ll send it to them so they can do the review on your behalf.

Complete and return this to us [by post](/write-to-us#centrelink).

You’ll need to submit your review with all supporting documents by the due date or your payment may stop.

You can also access the [Special Benefit review form](/bc048m) online.
