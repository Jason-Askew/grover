# Prepare to transfer to Age Pension

You can’t get JobSeeker Payment if you’re over Age Pension age.

-   [What happens if you transfer](#a2)
-   [How to confirm your decision](#a3)

## What you need to know

We’ll invite you to apply to [transfer to Age Pension](/transfer-to-age-pension?context=51411) 13 weeks before you’re [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension). You need to tell us 2 things. These are if you:

-   want to transfer
-   have superannuation.

If you don’t do this, we can’t check your eligibility or transfer you to [Age Pension](/age-pension).

We’ll send the invitation to your online account if you have one. If you don’t, we’ll post the invitation and form to you. We’ll fill in the online transfer or form with details we already know about you.

You can’t get JobSeeker Payment once you’re [Age Pension age](/who-can-get-age-pension) or older. This is because you no longer meet the eligibility requirements.

Read more about [who can get JobSeeker Payment](/who-can-get-jobseeker-payment?context=51411).

You can use our [Payment Finder](https://www.centrelink.gov.au/apps/clkonline_cof/payment-service-finder/payments-finder) to see what else you may be eligible for.

## What happens if you transfer

If you transfer to Age Pension:

-   you may get a higher rate of payment than the standard rate of JobSeeker Payment
-   more generous income and assets tests
-   you’ll get a [Pensioner Concession Card](/pensioner-concession-card) if you don’t have one already
-   you’ll get the [Work Bonus](/work-bonus).

If you transfer, we may also exempt more land from the assets test. This applies if you live on a single land title that covers more than 2 hectares.

Keep in mind, some of these factors may change based on your individual circumstances.

## How to confirm your decision

You need to confirm if you want to transfer by either:

-   completing the online task
-   returning the form we send you.

You also have to tell us about any superannuation you have.
