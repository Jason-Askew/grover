## Coronavirus (COVID-19) travel advice

Check [advice for international visitors](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/travel-health?language=und) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

If you’ve had a COVID-19 vaccination, make sure you have proof from the country where you got it. You’ll need this to make sure your vaccination is officially recorded on the Australian Immunisation Register. Read about [how to get an immunisation history statement](/how-to-get-immunisation-history-statements?context=22436) as proof of vaccination.

You can also read about [COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines?language=en) on the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing website.

## Before you travel

Check [what you need to do](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/entering-australia/overview) before you visit Australia on the Department of Home Affairs website. It covers things like:

-   travel restrictions
-   travel declarations
-   [types of visas](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing#content-index-1) for work, study, family or holidays.

You may be able to get social security payments while you’re in Australia. Find out which countries we have [international social security agreements](/international-social-security-agreements) with.

## Study in Australia

Find out about [studying in Australia](https://www.studyaustralia.gov.au/) on the Study Australia website, including:

-   university locations
-   costs
-   academic requirements
-   visa requirements
-   how to apply.

Read about [studying and training visas](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing#content-index-1) on the Department of Home Affairs website.

## Work in Australia

You need the right visa to work in Australia. There are 2 types of working visas:

-   Skilled Migration Visas for workers who have skills the Australian labour market needs
-   Sponsored Work Visas for people with an Australian employer, authority or government agency sponsoring them.

Read the full list of [working visas](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing#content-index-1) on the Department of Home Affairs website.

## Health care when you visit

Australia has subsidised health care for Australian citizens, residents and people on some temporary visas.

Check if the country you’re visiting from has a [Reciprocal Health Care Agreement](/when-reciprocal-health-care-agreements-apply-and-you-visit-australia). If so, your country’s public health system may cover your health care costs while you’re in Australia.

If you’re not from a reciprocal country, you should get private health insurance. You’ll usually need this to get a visa. If you don’t, you’ll need to pay the full cost of any hospital, ambulance or doctor fees in Australia.
