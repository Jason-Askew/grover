## on this page

-   [Payment Finder](#paymentandservicefinder)
-   [Compensation estimator](#a2)
-   [Child support care estimator](#childsupportcare)
-   [Child support estimator](#childsupport)
-   [Other online tools](#a5)

## Payment Finder

Payment Finder can help you work out how much money you may get. It can work out amounts of:

-   Centrelink payments, including pensions and allowances
-   [Family Tax Benefit](/family-tax-benefit)
-   child care fee assistance.

To use the Payment Finder, answer the questions and choose a payment you want to estimate.

You can also use it to compare payments if you have a dependent child aged 16-19 and they’re studying. You can compare family assistance payments with payments for [Youth Allowance](/youth-allowance) or [ABSTUDY](/abstudy). This will help you work out which payment is better for you.

## Child support care estimator

-   stay on top of bills
-   start putting money towards the things you want to buy in the future
-   manage unexpected expenses.
