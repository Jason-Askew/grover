# Concessional families

If you’re registered as a Medicare Safety Net family, you may be eligible as a Concessional Safety Net family.

You’re a Concessional Safety Net family (concessional family) when your family meets both of these conditions:

-   2 or more people in your registered Medicare Safety Net family have an eligible concession card
-   1 of the people with a concession card must be the Medicare Safety Net family contact or spouse.

Only registered Medicare Safety Net family members with a concession card are eligible for the Concessional Safety Net threshold.

All other members of your Medicare Safety Net family without a concession card aren’t part of the concessional family. This means they’re not eligible for the Concessional Safety Net threshold.

## Example of an eligible concessional family

Dylan, his daughter Grace and his partner Sam register as a Medicare Safety Net family. Dylan has a concession card, so he’s a concessional individual. Dylan’s dependant, Grace has a concession card too.

Dylan and Grace form a concessional family and are eligible for the Concessional Safety Net threshold.

Sam doesn’t have a concession card. This means Sam isn’t part of the concessional family and isn’t eligible for the Concessional Safety Net threshold.
