# FAMILIES

# Family Tax Benefit Part A

Family Tax Benefit Part A is a supplementary payment to assist low and middle income families with the direct costs of raising dependent children. It is paid for each eligible child in the family and can be paid in fortnightly instalments or as an annual lump sum.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ftb or call us on the Families line (page 61).

# Basic conditions of eligibility

• Claimant must have a Family Tax Benefit child (page 59).

• Can be paid to a parent, guardian or an approved care organisation.

• Only one member of a couple can receive payment. Eligibility follows the child, not the parent.

# Residence requirements

• Claimant must be an Australian resident (page 60), an SCV holder (page 60) residing in Australia, the holder of a specified temporary visa (page 60), or an eligible Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme worker or family member (page 60).

• The child must also meet these requirements or must be living with the claimant.

• A newly arrived resident’s waiting period (page 58) of 52 weeks applies to claimants. Some exemptions may apply.

May be paid for up to 6 weeks of a recipient or child’s temporary absence from Australia. However, specified temporary visa holders may only be paid in limited circumstances.

# Payment rates and methods of payment

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Family situation | Per fortnightPer year |  |
| Maximum rates |  |  |
| Each child aged 0 to 12 |  | $227.36 $6,865.65 |
| Each child aged 13 to 19 |  | $295.82 $8,650.50 |
| Each child aged 0 to 19, in an approved care organisation |  | $72.94 $1,901.65 |
| Base rate |  |  |
| Each child aged 0 to 19 |  | $72.94 $2,839.70 |

Annual amounts (except for the approved care organisation rate) include the end of year supplement ($938.05 per child), while the fortnightly amounts do not. Eligible families may also receive Energy Supplement (page 39).

• Parents caring for a child for $3 5 %$ to $6 5 %$ of the time may share these rates with another carer or carers. • Parents caring for a child for $14 %$ to $34 %$ of the time can’t receive these rates, but may be able to receive Rent Assistance, a Health Care Card, Remote Area Allowance,

Child Care Subsidy and the lower threshold of the Medicare Safety Net.

• Families can submit a claim up to 3 months before the expected birth of the child or when the child is expected to enter their care.

• Families can choose to have their payments made either fortnightly or as a lump sum after the end of the financial year. Families with outstanding tax returns or related debts may not be able to receive their payments fortnightly.

• For families claiming after the end of a financial year: – the claimant must submit the claim within 12 months after the end of that year, and – the claimant and their partner must lodge an income tax return, or notify us of their income if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months after the end of that year.

• For families receiving fortnightly instalments, the recipient and their partner must lodge an income tax return, or notify us of their income if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months after the end of the financial year. If they

don’t, they must repay any amounts they have received.

Call us on the Families line (page 61) if there are circumstances preventing you from submitting your claim or lodging your income tax return.

# End of year supplement

The Family Tax Benefit Part A end of year supplement ($938.05 per child) is paid after the end of the financial year.

To be eligible for the end of year supplement:

• a family must have a combined adjustable taxable income (page 59) of $$ 80,000$ or less, and • the recipient and their partner must lodge an income tax return, or notify us of their income if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months after the end of the financial year.

The end of year supplement may be used to offset overpayments.

# Multiple Birth Allowance

Multiple Birth Allowance is a supplementary payment to help with the extra costs associated with births of triplets or more. It is paid as part of Family Tax Benefit Part A and doesn’t require a separate claim.

Families with at least 3 children born during the same multiple birth may be eligible until the children turn 16, or if at least 3 of the children are in full-time study, until the end of the calendar year in which they turn 18.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Family situation | Per fortnight Per year |
| Triplets | $196.56 $5,124.60 |
| Quadruplets or more | $261.94 $6,829.15 |

# Supplementary support

Families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A are often also eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part B (page 4).

The table below outlines some other common forms of supplementary support for Family Tax Benefit Part A recipients, if they meet the eligibility criteria.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Payments Available to: |
| Parental Leave Pay (page 10) | recipients with a newborn or newly |
| Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment (page 4) | adopted child. |
| Parenting Payment (page 12) | recipients with principal care of a young child. |
| Child Care Subsidy (page 7) | recipients with a child in approved child care. |
| Rent Assistance (page 38) | recipients renting in the private rental market or community housing. Go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ rentassistance for more information about eligibility and related rules. |
| Concession cards | Automatically issued to: |
| Health Care Card (page 45) | lower income families. |

For more information about payments and services based on individual circumstances, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/paymentfinder

# Family Tax Benefit advance

Families may also be able to access a lump sum Family Tax Benefit advance if their fortnightly rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A is at least the base rate for one child, and if repayment of the advance will not cause them to suffer financial hardship. Up to $7 . 5 %$ of a family’s annual Family Tax Benefit Part A entitlement may be paid in advance at any one time, up to a $$ 1,381.13$ limit.

Go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/advancepayments for more information about eligibility and related rules.

# Immunisation and health check requirements

To meet the immunisation requirements, a child must be up to date with their early childhood vaccinations, on a catch-up schedule according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook or have a valid exemption. Families have their rate reduced for each child not meeting the immunisation requirements.

Health check requirements also apply to families where the recipient or their partner receive an income support payment and who have a child that turns 4 during the financial year. These families have their rate reduced if their child hasn’t had a health check by the time they turn 5, or if the family hasn’t told us the child has had their health check.

The rate reduction for not meeting either requirement is $$ 35.28$ per fortnight. The reduction also applies to lump sum claims.

# Assets test

• No assets test.

# Income test

The rate of payment depends on a family’s combined annual adjusted taxable income (page 59). Families receiving fortnightly instalments provide an estimate of their income for the financial year. To reduce or avoid overpayment, families can elect to be paid at a lower rate throughout the year. The income test doesn’t apply to families where a parent receives certain income support payments (including certain Department of Veterans’ Affairs payments) at a rate above nil.

In most cases, the rate is calculated using 2 income tests. The test that results in the higher rate applies.

# Maximum rate income test

• Income up to $$ 66,722$ per year has no effect on the rate of payment. • Each dollar of income between $$ 66,722$ and $$ 123,77$ reduces the maximum rate of payment by 20 cents. • Each dollar of income above $$ 123,77$ reduces the maximum rate of payment by 30 cents.

# Base rate income test

• Income up to $$ 123,77$ per year has no effect on the rate of payment.

• Each dollar of income above $$ 123,77$ reduces the base rate of payment by 30 cents.

Annual income limits above which Family Tax Benefit Part A may not be paid

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number of Aged 13 to 19children0 1 2 3 |
| Aged | 0 | $125,110$135,488$161,197 |
| 1 | $125,110$131,449$155,247$180,955 |
| 0 to 12 | 2 | $131,449$149,298 $175,006 $200,714 |
| 3 | $143,348$169,056 $194,764 $220,473 |

Income limits vary depending on a family’s circumstances and may be higher if they receive additional supplements, such as Energy Supplement or Rent Assistance. Please contact us for more information based on your circumstances.

# How maintenance affects Family Tax Benefit

A person’s rate may be affected if they or their partner receive child support or spousal maintenance from a former partner, or if they don’t take reasonable action to obtain child support.

For more information, go to

servicesaustralia.gov.au/csandftba or call us on the Families line (page 61).

# Maintenance action test

If a person or their partner cares for children from a previous relationship, they can apply for a child support assessment by going to servicesaustralia.gov.au/childsupportassessment or by calling us on the Child Support Enquiry Line (page 61).

If they don’t take reasonable action to obtain child support, or seek an exemption from this requirement, they may only receive the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A for the children.

For more information, or if there are circumstances that make it difficult for you to apply for child support from the other parent, including family and domestic violence or because the children’s parentage is unknown, call us on the Families line (page 61).

# Maintenance income test

• Each dollar of maintenance received over the maintenance income free area may reduce the maximum rate by 50 cents for each child attracting maintenance. It doesn’t reduce the base rate or the rate for children who don’t attract maintenance.

|     |
| --- |
| Maintenance income Family situation free area (per year) |
| Single parent, or one of a couple $2,003.85 receiving maintenance |
| Couple, each receiving $4,007.70 maintenance |
| For each additional child, add $667.95 |

# Newborn Supplement and Newborn Upfront Payment

Newborn Supplement provides a temporary fortnightly increase to Family Tax Benefit Part A to help families with the costs of a newborn or adopted child. Newborn Upfront Payment provides an initial lump sum to assist with immediate costs.

Families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A are automatically assessed for eligibility if they aren’t accessing Parental Leave Pay for the child.

For more information, go to

servicesaustralia.gov.au/newbornsupplement or call us on the Families line (page 61).

# Basic conditions of eligibility

• Payable in addition to Family Tax Benefit Part A for a child who is:

– aged less than one and in the care of a parent, or – aged less than one and becomes entrusted to the care of a non-parent carer for a continuous period of at least 13 weeks, or

– any age and becomes entrusted to care through the process of adoption, and the adopting parent or their partner is eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part A within 12 months of the child’s entrustment to care.

• Families can’t receive both Newborn Supplement and Parental Leave Pay (page 10) for the same child. For multiple births (for example, twins or triplets), Parental Leave Pay may be paid for one child and Newborn Supplement for the other child or children, or Newborn Supplement may be paid for each child.

Payment rates and methods of payment

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Family situation | Newborn Supplement (over 13 weeks) | Newborn Upfront Payment | Total (over 13 weeks) |

| Subsequent children | $685.23 | $683 | $1,368.23 |

• Newborn Supplement is paid fortnightly with Family Tax Benefit Part A for up to 13 weeks, or as part of a lump sum claim after the end of the financial year. If paid fortnightly, the first instalment includes Newborn Upfront Payment.

# Family Tax Benefit Part B

Family Tax Benefit Part B is a supplementary payment to assist single parent families, non-parent carers and some couple families with one main income earner. It is paid per family, based on the age of the youngest child, and can be paid in fortnightly instalments or as an annual lump sum.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ftb or call us on the Families line (page 61).

# Basic conditions of eligibility

• Claimant must: – have a Family Tax Benefit child (page 59) aged under 13, or – have a Family Tax Benefit child aged 13, up to the end of the calendar year they turn 18, and be a single parent, a grandparent or a great-grandparent.

• Only one member of a couple can receive payment. Eligibility follows the child, not the parent.

• Family Tax Benefit Part B can’t be paid to a person or their partner for any days or periods they receive Parental Leave Pay (page 10).

# Residence requirements

• Claimant must be an Australian resident (page 60), an SCV holder (page 60) residing in Australia, the holder of a specified temporary visa (page 60), or an eligible Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme worker or family member (page 60).

• The child must meet the above requirements or must be living with the claimant.

• May be paid for up to 6 weeks of a recipient or child’s temporary absence from Australia. However, specified temporary visa holders may only be paid in limited circumstances.

• Parents caring for a child for $14 %$ to $34 %$ of the time can’t receive these rates, but may be able to receive Rent Assistance, a Health Care Card, Remote Area Allowance, Child Care Subsidy and the lower threshold of the Medicare Safety Net.

• Families can submit a claim up to 3 months before the expected birth of the child or when the child is expected to enter their care.

• Families can choose to have their payments made either fortnightly or as a lump sum after the end of the financial year. Families with outstanding tax returns or related debts may not be able to receive their payments fortnightly.

• For families claiming after the end of a financial year:

– the claimant must submit the claim within 12 months after the end of that year, and – the claimant and their partner must lodge an income tax return, or notify us of their income if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months after the end of that year.

• For families receiving fortnightly instalments, the recipient and their partner must lodge an income tax return, or notify us of their income if they are not required to lodge an income tax return, within 12 months after the end of the financial year. If they don’t, they must repay any amounts they have received.

• Call us on the Families line (page 61) if there are circumstances preventing you from submitting your claim or lodging your income tax return.

# End of year supplement

The end of year supplement may be used to offset overpayments.

# Assets test

• No assets test.

The rate of payment depends on a family’s annual adjusted taxable income (page 59). Families receiving fortnightly instalments provide an estimate of their income for the financial year. To reduce or avoid overpayment, families can elect to defer their payment throughout the year.

# Single families

• Single parents receive the maximum rate if they receive certain income support payments (including certain Department of Veterans’ Affairs payments) or if their annual income is $$ 120,007$ or less. If their income is above this amount, Family Tax Benefit Part B is not paid to the family.

# Couple families

• The higher earner must have an annual income of $$ 120,007$ or less. If their income is above this amount, Family Tax Benefit Part B is not paid to the family. • The lower earner can have an annual income of up to $$ 6,935$ and still receive the maximum rate. Each dollar of income above this amount reduces the rate of payment by 20 cents. Income support payments count as income towards this test.

The rate of payment reaches nil at the income limits in the table below.

Annual income limits above which Family Tax Benefit Part B may not be paid

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |

For more information about eligibility and income testing, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/sifs

# Child Care Subsidy

Child Care Subsidy aims to assist families with the cost of approved child care to support their workforce participation, and to meet the early childhood education needs for children.

# Basic conditions of eligibility

To be eligible for Child Care Subsidy the child must:

• attend approved child care

• be a Family Tax Benefit or regular care child of the claimant or their partner

• be 13 or younger and not attending secondary school

• meet the immunisation requirements.

In some circumstances a claimant may be eligible for a child who is aged 13 or under attending secondary school, or a child aged 14 and up to 18. For example, a child with a disability or medical condition.

The claimant or their partner must:

• meet the residence requirements

• have a genuine liability for the payment of child care fees under a Complying Written Arrangement with their child care provider.

# Residence requirements

The claimant or their partner must be an Australian resident (page 60), an SCV holder (page 60) residing in Australia, the holder of a specified temporary visa (page 60), an eligible Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme worker or family member (page 60), or be one of the following:

• a student from outside Australia directly sponsored by the Australian Government

• a non-resident experiencing hardship or special circumstances.

Child Care Subsidy may be paid for up to 6 weeks of a recipient’s temporary absence from Australia. However, specified temporary visa holders may only be paid in limited circumstances.

Payment during subsequent absences may be affected by the length of time a recipient spends in Australia since their last return from overseas.

Child Care Subsidy is not affected by a child-only temporary absence from Australia, however, regular Child Care Subsidy allowable absence rules apply.

# Immunisation requirements

To meet the immunisation requirements, the child needs to be up to date with their early childhood vaccinations, on a catch‑up schedule according to the current Australian Immunisation Handbook or have a valid exemption.

# Other factors affecting eligibility

There are several other factors affecting Child Care Subsidy eligibility. For example, the session of care must be provided in Australia, and must not be provided as part of the compulsory education program in the state or territory where the care is provided.

Child Care Subsidy can be paid for up to 42 allowable absences per child per financial year for any reason without the family needing to provide evidence. If the 42 allowable absences are used, additional absence days are available for certain reasons, for example, the child being ill, if supporting evidence is provided to their child care provider.

Child Care Subsidy enrolments cease if a child does not attend a session of care in 14 consecutive weeks. Generally, there is no entitlement to Child Care Subsidy for absences between a child’s last attendance day and the date the enrolment ceases.

Child Care Subsidy eligibility is cancelled if no sessions of care are reported for 26 consecutive weeks. Families will need to submit a new Child Care Subsidy claim if the child re-commences care after this period.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/childcaresubsidy

# Child Care Subsidy entitlement

Child Care Subsidy entitlement depends on all of these:

• the combined annual adjusted taxable income of the claimant and their partner, if they have one (page 59) • whether a family has multiple Child Care Subsidy eligible children aged five years or under • the level of recognised participation and circumstances of the claimant and their partner, if they have one • the type of approved child care service used, and whether the child attends school.

# Assets test

• No assets test.

# Standard Child Care Subsidy rate

• Families earning $$ 85,279$ or less get a subsidy of $9 0 %$ of the actual fee charged (up to $9 0 %$ of an hourly fee cap). For family incomes above $$ 85,279$ , the subsidy gradually decreases to $0 %$ when family income reaches $$ 535,279$ . For families with incomes of $$ 535,279$ or more, the subsidy is $0 %$ .

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Family income | Standard Child CareSubsidy rate |
| Up to $85,279 | 90% |
| More than$85,279 to below$535,279 | decreasing from 90%the percentage decreasesby 1% for every $5,000 ofincome a family earns. |
| $535,279 or more | 0% |

All Child Care Subsidy rates in this guide take effect from 7 July 2025. Previous year rates can be found in the previous version of this guide, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/paymentsguide

# Higher Child Care Subsidy for multiple children – families with more than one child aged 5 or under

• The rates of each child are worked out using two separate income tests. • Families with income below $$ 367,563$ and more than one child aged 5 or under in care may get a higher subsidy for one or more of their children. The ‘standard rate’ child is usually the eldest Child Care Subsidy eligible child aged 5 or under. The standard rate child will get the standard Child Care Subsidy rates. • The higher rate child is the second and any younger children aged 5 or under. The higher rate for second and younger children is calculated using the below rates.

|     |     |

• If Child Care Subsidy eligibility for one or more children stops, entitlement to higher Child Care Subsidy for other children aged 5 or under may be reassessed. • Children who are entitled to both the higher Child Care Subsidy rate and Additional Child Care Subsidy will be paid the Additional Child Care Subsidy rate. Sessions of In Home Care do not attract the higher subsidy for younger children. This is because In Home Care is subsidised on a family rather than per child basis. However, children aged 5 or under in the family unit are included when determining access to the higher Child Care Subsidy rate, if they attend other approved care types.

# Hours of subsidised child care — Recognised Participation

From 5 January 2026, all families can get at least 72 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight.

Families can get 100 hours of subsidised child care per fortnight for each child if:

• the claimant and their partner, if they have one, each engage in more than 48 hours of recognised participation per fortnight or, • the claimant has a valid exemption.

For couples, the person with the lowest recognised participation is used to work out hours of subsidised child care.

The following table shows the number of hours of subsidised child care per fortnight a person can get based on their hours of recognised participation.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Recognised participation hours per fortnight | Hours of subsidised care, per child each fortnight |
| 0 hours to 48 hours | 72 hours. |
| More than 48 hours | 100 hours |
| Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children | 100 hours for each Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander child in your care |
| Have an exemption, or exceptional circumstances | 100 hours |

• The claimant can combine recognised participation types, and include reasonable travel time, when declaring their hours of recognised participation. Travel time is the time taken travelling from the approved child care service to the place where they do the recognised participation and travel from this place back to the child care service. Recognised participation hours do not need to coincide with child care hours.

• Recognised participation types can include:

– paid work, including leave, like maternity leave – study and training

– unpaid work in a family business

– looking for work

– volunteering

– self-employment.

• Families can request additional hours of subsidised child care if they have exceptional circumstances. Applications for additional hours are assessed on a case by case basis.

• Families where all CCS eligible children are identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander are not required to report recognised participation details.

• Families should go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ child-care-subsidy to find out more about recognised participation types and how to report your recognised participation.

# Hourly rate caps

• The hourly rate caps are the maximum hourly rate the Government subsidises for each child care service type. The caps and families’ Child Care Subsidy percentage are used to calculate the amount of subsidy per hour a family can get for each child attending approved child care. • Where a child care provider charges a fee that is less than the hourly rate cap, families get their applicable percentage of the actual fee charged. Where a child care provider charges a fee that is equal to or above the relevant rate cap, families get their applicable percentage of the hourly rate cap. • A child’s attendance at school determines the hourly rate cap that applies to children attending centre based day care and outside school hours care.

• The hourly rate caps are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Hourly rate cap Child I care service type for children below school age | Hourly rate cap for school aged children |
| Centre based day care $14.63 | $12.81 |
| Outside school hours care | $14.63 $12.81 |
| Family day care | $13.56 $13.56 |
| In home care (per family) | $39.80 $39.80 |

For the hourly rate caps, a child is considered to be attending school from the first day they are scheduled to physically attend the school, and where any of the following apply:

• the child has turned 6

• the child attends the year of school before grade 1

• the child attends primary or secondary school

• the child is home schooled as recognised in the state or territory where the child resides

• the child would be attending school (the year of school before grade 1, primary school or secondary school), except that the child is absent from school, or is on holidays.

# Payment of Child Care Subsidy

Child Care Subsidy is generally paid directly to approved child care providers to be passed on as a fee reduction to families.

After the end of each financial year, Services Australia balances a claimant’s Child Care Subsidy payments to ensure they received the correct amount. They do this by comparing the amount of Child Care Subsidy paid based on the family’s estimated adjusted taxable income, with the amount they are entitled to receive based on their actual adjusted taxable income (page 59).

Throughout the year, all families have $5 %$ of their weekly entitlement to Child Care Subsidy withheld to reduce the likelihood of families incurring a debt at the end of financial year when Child Care Subsidy is balanced. Families can request a variation to the default withholding percentage, either a decrease or increase, to suit their particular circumstances.

When Child Care Subsidy is balanced, if the family’s actual income is higher than estimated, they may have been overpaid and incurred a debt. Any amounts withheld during the year will be offset to reduce the debt amount. Where families received the correct amount of subsidy or less than they were entitled to, the amount withheld, and any additional amount is paid directly to them.

In order for Child Care Subsidy to be balanced, you and your partner must confirm your income by lodging an income tax return or telling Services Australia you are not required to lodge and providing your actual income. If you have separated from your partner, you may need to contact us to discuss their tax lodgement requirements. You need to do this within 12 months after the relevant financial year or your ongoing Child Care Subsidy will stop.

If after 24 months you still have not confirmed your income for the relevant financial year, any Child Care Subsidy you received for that year will have to be repaid and your Child Care Subsidy eligibility will be cancelled. Once you have confirmed your income you will have to lodge a new Child Care Subsidy claim if you wish to be paid Child Care Subsidy.

# Home Equity Access Scheme

The Home Equity Access Scheme gives older Australians the ability to draw down on their real estate assets to support a higher standard of living in retirement. It’s a voluntary loan scheme that can provide a fortnightly non-taxable payment, lump sum advance payments, or both. Pensioners and non‑pensioners may be eligible.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/homeequityaccess

# Basic conditions of eligibility

• Claimant must:

– be of Age Pension age, or be partnered to a person of Age Pension age, and

– qualify for Age Pension, Disability Support Pension or Carer Payment (even if they don’t actually receive a payment, for example due to their income or assets), and

–own, or be partnered to a person who owns, real estate in Australia that can secure the loan, and

– have adequate and appropriate insurance covering the secured assets, and

– not be bankrupt or subject to a personal insolvency agreement.

# Payment rates

The amount of combined pension and loan payment a person can receive can’t exceed $1 5 0 %$ of the maximum rate of pension. See table below for the typical maximum rates of pension (including Pension Supplement and Energy Supplement) and the typical combined pension plus loan payment amounts.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 150% of theMaximum rateStatus maximum rateof pensionof pension |
| Single $1,178.70 | $1,768.05 |
| Partnered $888.50 | $1,332.75 |
| Couple combined $1,777.00 | $2,665.50 |

These amounts vary depending on a person’s circumstances. They may be higher if a person qualifies for Rent Assistance.

• A maximum rate pensioner can receive an additional $5 0 %$ of the maximum rate of pension as a loan payment.

• Non-pensioners can receive $1 5 0 %$ of the maximum rate of pension as a loan payment.

• The amount part-rate pensioners can receive varies between $5 0 %$ and $1 5 0 %$ , depending on the amount of pension they already receive.

A person can nominate their maximum loan amount, change the amount they receive each fortnight, as well as stop and restart their loan payments at any time.

# Advance payments

A person can access up to two lump sum advances in a 26 fortnight period, up to a combined total of $5 0 %$ of the maximum annual rate of Age Pension.

|     |
| --- |
| Status Maximum lump sum advance |
| Single $15,323.10 |
| Partnered $11,550.50 |
| Couple combined $23,101.00 |

Any advance a person takes does not affect their rate of pension, but does reduce their maximum fortnightly loan payment from the Scheme and any additional lump sum advances taken in the following 26 fortnight period.

# Loan details

Home Equity Access Scheme debts accrue interest, compounded fortnightly. The Minister for Social Services sets the interest rate. At the time this document was produced, the annual interest rate was $3 . 9 5 %$ .

Interest is calculated daily on the amount of loan payments received, previously accrued interest and any loan set-up costs.

There is a limit on how much a person can borrow in total. This amount depends on their age (or their partner’s age, if younger) and the value of the equity in the property securing the loan.

A person can make repayments in part or in full at any time. If they sell the property, they can either repay the loan or transfer it to another property. If there’s an outstanding loan after their death, we will generally recover it from their estate. If they have a surviving partner, the partner can repay the loan or continue in the scheme, if eligible.

There is a no negative equity guarantee on Home Equity Access Scheme loans, which applies when a debt is settled. This prevents a person or their estate from paying more than the market value of the property secured against the loan, minus any other mortgages or encumbrances.

# DISABILITY SUPPORT

# Disability Support Pension

Disability Support Pension is an income support payment for people who are unable to support themselves through employment due to a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment resulting from a disability or condition.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/dsp or call us on the disability, sickness and carers line (page 61).

under a single Impairment Table, but attracts at

least 20 points under multiple Impairment Tables,

the claimant must have also actively participated in a

Program of Support.

The Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme is a group of payments that provide assistance to families of students without access to an appropriate state school. For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/aic or call us on the Assistance for Isolated Children line (page 61).

# Basic conditions of eligibility

Families of primary, secondary and certain tertiary students who do not have reasonable daily access to an appropriate state school can receive:

• Boarding Allowance for students who must board away from home, in a school, hostel or privately, or • Distance Education Allowance for students who are enrolled in full time studies in an approved distance education course, or • Second Home Allowance to maintain a second home so that a student can access school daily, or • Pensioner Education Supplement for students aged under 21 receiving Disability Support Pension or Parenting Payment (Single) and studying at primary level.

Students must:

• not have reasonable access to an appropriate state school due to being geographically isolated or having special needs, and

• be undertaking approved studies at an approved education provider, and

• be at least the minimum school entry age, and be aged under 19 at 1 January. Certain pensioner students may be eligible until they turn 21. Tertiary students must be either under the minimum age that the state or territory requires them to participate in education or training, or aged under 16, whichever is greater.

An appropriate state school is normally one that offers tuition at the grade or year in which the student is qualified to enrol (for example, Year 11). If the student has a health-related condition (including a disability) or special educational needs, the nearest appropriate state school is one that provides access to the facilities, programs, or environment required to meet the student’s needs.

Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme payments generally can’t be paid if the student receives an income support payment or other Government education or training assistance, but they can be paid if a family receives Family Tax Benefit for the student. Family Tax Benefit can’t be paid for students aged 16 or over receiving Youth Allowance. Depending on parental income and other circumstances, a student may receive a higher level of assistance if they are eligible for Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY or Pensioner Education Supplement.

# Assets test

# Activity requirements

• The net asset limit (or equity) is $$ 5.5$ million and applies to couples (combined assets) and to a single person. This means you deduct any debts against your assets. Your estimate of the value should be based on a walk in/ walk out amount that can be reasonably expected in the current market and conditions. The limit includes farm and non-farm assets. The value of your principal home and surrounding land (up to 2 hectares on the same title) is not included as long as the land is not being used for business activities.

# Income test

• Farm Household Allowance is paid based on the latest tax return or, if the business income has changed significantly since then, an estimate of business income.

• Business income estimates should reflect current income and must be updated whenever that changes. Only profit is included as income. The ‘Profit and Loss Statement’ form (SU580) on the Services Australia website may help you estimate your business income.

• See Module D (page 51) for JobSeeker Payment limits for recipients aged 22 and over.

• See Module F (page 52) for Youth Allowance limits for recipients aged under 22.

• There is no reduction to the rate of Farm Household Allowance. If any Farm Household Allowance is payable after the income test is applied, the maximum rate is paid. Where the income limit is exceeded, no payment is made.

• Recipients whose farm enterprise and/or a related business is making a loss can offset their off‑farm income to a maximum of $$ 100,000$ (or the amount of the loss, whichever is the lesser).

• A business is a related business of a farm enterprise if it is carried on principally to provide goods or services to the agricultural or aquacultural industries, and there is a sufficient commercial relationship between the enterprise and the business.

# SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS

# Rent Assistance

Rent Assistance is a supplementary payment to help meet the costs of renting in the private rental market or community housing. It is paid as part of another payment and it may be reduced due to the income and assets test rules applying to that payment.

To qualify for Rent Assistance, a person must generally pay rent to a private landlord or community housing provider, and receive a qualifying payment – either an income support payment (page 59) or more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A. A person’s payment rate depends on their relationship status, the number of children they care for, and the amount of rent they pay. Recipients with children generally receive Rent Assistance with Family Tax Benefit Part A, but they may receive it with their income support payment in certain circumstances.

Rent Assistance is only paid if a person pays more than the rent threshold. Rent Assistance is calculated at 75 cents for each dollar of rent above the rent threshold, up to the maximum rate. The maximum rate is paid when a person’s rent reaches the rent ceiling.

Energy Supplement is a supplementary payment made to most income support recipients to assist with energy costs. It doesn’t require a separate claim.

# MEANS TESTING

# Assets testing

This section outlines the basic assets testing rules for income support payments. Please contact us for more information based on your circumstances.

An asset is any property or possession that a person owns, including money, shares, financial investments, investment properties, vacant land, holiday homes, motor vehicles, caravans, boats, household contents, personal effects, businesses, farms, other personal assets (whether in Australia or overseas) and superannuation for people of Age Pension age (or superannuation for people under Age Pension age if a payment is being received from it).

Certain assets are exempt from the assets test, including a person’s principal home and some adjacent land, and superannuation for people under Age Pension age (unless a payment is being received from it).

For more examples of assessable and exempt assets, and more detailed rules about their treatment, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/assets

# Gifting

If a person gives away assets or sells them for less than their market value without receiving adequate compensation, we may still count them in the assets and income tests. Amounts given away above $$ 10,000$ per financial year, or $$ 30,000$ over 5 financial years (which can’t include more than $$ 10,000$ in a single financial year), are assessed as assets and deemed to earn income for 5 years from the date of the gift.

For more information about different types of gifts, and exceptions to the gifting rules, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/gifting

# Hardship provisions

It is sometimes not possible for people with assets but little or no income to rearrange their affairs to provide for themselves. If a person is in severe financial hardship they may be able to get an income support payment under different tests. Please contact us for more information.

# Special Disability Trusts

A special disability trust is a trust established primarily for succession planning by parents and immediate family members for the future care and accommodation needs of a person with severe disability. ‘Special’ refers to the social security treatment of the trust and is not a reference to the principal beneficiary’s disability. Before a special disability trust can be established the person needs to establish that they meet the definition of severe disability as well as other eligibility requirements. There are general requirements and means test concessions for special disability trusts that apply from 20 September 2006.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/disabilitytrusts

# Module A – Assets test for pensions

The assets test for pensions applies to Age Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment. The rate of payment is calculated under both the income and assets tests. The test that results in the lower rate (or nil rate) applies.

• Assets up to the assets free area have no effect on the rate of payment.

• For every $$ 1,000$ of assets above the assets free area, the rate of payment is reduced by $$ 3$ per fortnight.

• This reduction applies until the assets limit is reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

| Couple combined (including illness separatedor where only one partner is eligible) | $739,500 |

# Income testing

This section outlines the basic income testing rules for income support payments. Please contact us for more information based on your circumstances.

In general, the income testing rules assess gross income from all sources. Common types of assessable income include income from employment, income streams (such as foreign pensions and private annuities), net rental income, net business income, and deemed income from financial investments.

Some forms of income are specifically exempt from the income test. This includes most payments made by us, payments for a dependent child, emergency relief and National Disability Insurance Scheme payments.

Special rules apply for certain types of income, such as lump sums, compensation, business income and income from trusts and companies.

For more examples of assessable and exempt income, and more detail about the special rules, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/income

# Lump sums

Remunerative lump sums, such as commissions or bonuses paid by an employer, are generally counted as income from the start of the instalment period in which they are paid for the length of time to which they relate. For example, 3 months of a commission would be assessed for a period of 3 months.

One-off or irregular non-remunerative lump sums, such as distributions from a trust or dividends from private companies, are generally counted as income over a 52 week period from the date a person becomes entitled to them.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/lumpsums

# Deeming

The deeming rules are used to calculate income from financial investments for income testing purposes. Financial investments include bank accounts, shares, managed investments, assessable gifted amounts and superannuation in some circumstances.

Deeming assumes that financial investments are earning a certain rate of income, regardless of the amount of income they’re actually earning. If a person actually earns more than these rates, we don’t assess the extra income.

We add a person’s deemed income to their assessable income from other sources, such as salary or wages, and apply the income test.

Deeming rates are set by the Minister for Social Services. The table below shows the thresholds and rates at the time this document was produced.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | Financial investments | Deeming rate (annual) |
| Single | the first $64,200 | 0.75% |
| additional amounts above $64,200 | 2.75% |
| Partnered (neither member receiving pension) | the first $53,100 | 0.75% |
| additional amounts above $53,100 | 2.75% |
| Couple combined (at least one member receiving pension) | the first $106,200 | 0.75% |
| additional amounts above $106,200 | 2.75% |

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/deeming

# Compensation

If a person or their partner receives a compensation payment, their income support payment rate may be affected. Periodic compensation payments are income tested differently depending on whether the compensation recipient was receiving an income support payment at the time of the compensable injury. A non-payment period may apply to recipients of lump sum compensation payments.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ centrelinkcompensationrecovery

# Businesses

Business income is calculated differently to employment income. If a person or their partner are involved in a business, we generally use their latest tax return to calculate their fortnightly assessable income. If their business income has changed significantly since then, an estimate reflecting their current situation can be used instead. Certain deductions can reduce assessable income. Business assets may also count towards the assets test. We add assessable business income and assets to a person’s income and assets from other sources and apply the income and assets tests.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/businessincome

# Trusts and companies

Special rules apply to income and assets from private trusts and companies. Depending on a range of factors, we may attribute some of the income or assets to a person. We then add these to a person’s income and assets from other sources and apply the income and assets tests.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/trustsandcompanies

# Income maintenance period

The income maintenance period applies when a claimant or their partner receives a lump sum leave or termination payment from their employer.

To calculate the income maintenance period, we divide the lump sum by the weekly amount the employer was paying the person when they were working. The result is the number of weeks the lump sum represents. We continue to assess the person as earning this level of income under the income test for the duration of this period.

The period may be reduced or waived if a person is in severe financial hardship. For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/incomemaintenanceperiod

# Module C – Income test for pensions

The income test for pensions applies to Age Pension, Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment. The rate of payment is calculated under both the income and assets tests. The test that results in the lower rate (or nil rate) applies.

• The income free area is $$ 218$ per fortnight for singles and $$ 380$ per fortnight for couples (combined). Income up to this amount has no effect on the rate of payment.

• Each dollar of income above these amounts reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents for singles, and 25 cents for couples (each).

• These reductions apply until the income limits are reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

• If of Age Pension age, the Work Bonus (page 56) reduces assessable income.

• If under Age Pension age, Working Credits (page 56) reduce assessable income.

• Transitional pensioners (page 13) have a different income test. For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/transitionalratepension

Income limits are calculated based on typical total rates, but they may vary depending on a person’s circumstances. For example, they may be higher if the person receives additional fortnightly supplements, such as Rent Assistance, or lower if the person doesn’t reside in Australia.

# Module D – Income test for JobSeeker Payment

# Personal income test

• The income free area is $$ 150$ per fortnight. Income up to this amount has no effect on the rate of payment.

– For single principal carers, each dollar of income above $$ 150$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 40 cents.

– For all other recipients, each dollar of income between $$ 150$ per fortnight and $$ 256$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents. Each dollar of income above $$ 256$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 60 cents.

• These reductions apply until the income limits are reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

• Working Credits (page 56) reduce assessable income.

Each dollar of income between $$ 150$ per fortnight and $$ 256$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents.

• Each dollar of income above $$ 256$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 60 cents.

• This reduction applies until the income limit is reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

• Working Credits (page 56) reduce assessable income.

# Partner income test

• Applies to independent recipients. See Module I (page 55).

# Parental income

Parental income may reduce a dependent recipient’s rate of payment. To calculate the reduction, we apply a parental income test and a maintenance income test. The reduction calculated in these tests is then compared to any reduction from the personal income test, and the larger reduction is applied.

# Parental income test

• The parental income free area is $$ 66,722$ . Parental income up to this amount has no effect on the rate of payment.

• Parental income is the parents’ combined adjusted taxable income (page 59) for 2024–25. If their income has significantly changed since then, we may use their income for 2025–26.

• Each dollar of income above the parental income free area reduces the rate of payment by 20 cents.

Because parental income can support multiple children, the 20 cent reduction is shared between other dependants in the family receiving a payment with a parental income test. The reduction is also shared with any Family Tax Benefit children (page 59) in the family.

• For example, if a family has 2 recipients of Youth Allowance (both aged 18 or over, away from home), each recipient’s rate is reduced by 10 cents for each dollar above the parental income free area. If the dependants attract different rates of payment, the reduction is shared based on each dependant’s share of the total maximum rate for all family members. The parental income test generally doesn’t apply if parent/s receive an income support payment (including Department of Veterans’ Affairs income support payments) at a rate above nil. The maintenance income test may still apply.

# Maintenance income test

• Each dollar of maintenance (for example, child support) received over the maintenance income free area reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents for each child attracting maintenance, up to a capped amount. It doesn’t reduce the rate of payment for children who don’t attract maintenance. The maintenance income free area depends on the number of children in the family attracting maintenance, and the payments (if any) they attract.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Parents receiving maintenance for: | Maintenance income free area (per year) |
| One Youth Allowance recipient | $2,003.85 |
| One Youth Allowance recipient and at least one Family Tax Benefit child | $667.95 |
| More than one Youth Allowance recipient but no Family Tax Benefit children | $2,003.85 for the first child, plus $667.95 for each additional child (total amount is shared equally between children) |

| Partnered, with orwithout dependentchildren | $539 $1,780.84 |

Income limits are calculated based on typical total rates, but they may vary depending on a person’s circumstances. For example, they may be higher if the person receives additional fortnightly supplements, such as Rent Assistance.

The Youth Allowance maintenance income test reduction applies on top of any Family Tax Benefit Part A maintenance income test reduction (page 4) for other children in the family.

# Module G – Income test for ABSTUDY Living Allowance

# Personal income test

• Applies to recipients aged 16 or over and independent Australian Apprentices aged under 16.

• The income free area is $$ 539$ per fortnight. Income up to this amount has no effect on the rate of payment.

• Each dollar of income between $$ 539$ per fortnight and $$ 646$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents.

• Each dollar of income above $$ 646$ per fortnight reduces the rate of payment by 60 cents.

• This reduction applies until the income limits are reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

• Income Bank credits (page 56) reduce assessable income.

• The first $$ 10,306$ of a merit and equity based scholarship is exempt from income testing.

# Partner income test

• Applies to independent recipients. See Module I (page 55).

# Parental income

• Parental income may reduce a dependent recipient’s rate of payment. To calculate the reduction, we apply a parental income test and a maintenance income test. This amount is then compared to any reduction from the personal income test, and the larger reduction is applied.

• The parental income test and maintenance income test are similar to those for Youth Allowance (page 53), but there are some differences. For more information based on your circumstances, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/abstudy or call us on the ABSTUDY line (page 61).

# Module H – Income test for Austudy

# Personal income test

• The income free area is $$ 539$ per fortnight. Income up to this amount has no effect on the rate of payment.

• Each dollar of income between $$ 539$ and $$ 646$ reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents.

• Each dollar of income above $$ 646$ reduces the rate of payment by 60 cents.

• This reduction applies until the income limits are reached (where the rate of payment is nil).

• Income Bank credits (page 56) reduce assessable income.

• The first $$ 10,306$ of a merit and equity based scholarship is exempt from income testing.

| Special rates for long term income support recipients |  |  |
| Single | $539 | $1,904.00 |
| Partnered | $539 | $1,791.67 |

Income limits are calculated based on typical total rates, but they may vary depending on a person’s circumstances. For example, they may be higher if the person receives additional fortnightly supplements, such as Rent Assistance.

# Partner income test

• See Module I (page 55).

# Module I – Partner income test

The partner income test applies to partnered recipients (page 59) of JobSeeker Payment, Parenting Payment, Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Austudy and Special Benefit. It applies in addition to the personal income test for these payments.

Recipients must always report their partner’s income, regardless of the amount.

The partner income test differs depending on a couple’s circumstances.

# Partner receiving income support allowance

In general, if a person’s partner also receives an income support allowance (for example, JobSeeker Payment, Parenting Payment, Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Austudy or Special Benefit), the partner’s income won’t affect the person’s payment.

# Partner receiving income support pension

If a person’s partner receives an income support pension (Age Pension, Disability Support Pension or Carer Payment), we use half of the couple’s combined income when applying the personal income test.

# Partner not receiving payment

If a person’s partner doesn’t receive an income support payment, the partner’s income won’t affect the person’s payment until it reaches the partner income free area. Each dollar of partner income above the partner income free area reduces the person’s rate of payment by 60 cents.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Partner income free area |
| Per fortnight |
| Partner aged 22 or over | $1,392.00 |
| Partner aged under 22, no dependent children | $1,307.00 |
| Partner aged under 22, with dependent children | $1,402.00 |

The partner income test works differently for some payments.

• For Special Benefit recipients, each dollar of partner income above the partner income free area reduces the rate of payment by one dollar. • For ABSTUDY Living Allowance recipients aged 22 or over, each dollar of partner income above the partner income free area ($1,392 per fortnight) reduces the rate of payment by 50 cents. The partner income free area is higher for recipients with dependent children.

These values are a guide only. Please contact us for more information based on your circumstances.

# Work Bonus

# Income Bank

The Work Bonus is an income test concession for Age Pension recipients who are working. It is also available to Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment recipients of Age Pension age.

Under the Work Bonus, the first $$ 300$ of employment income (and eligible self-employment income) is excluded from the pension income test each fortnight. Any unused amounts can be accrued to offset future employment income, up to a maximum of $$ 12300$ . Accrued amounts don’t expire.

New Work Bonus recipients commence with a $$ 4,000$ balance. The Work Bonus is applied automatically, and is calculated on an individual basis – it can’t be shared by a couple.

Transitional pensioners (page 13) don’t have access to the Work Bonus.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/workbonus

Income bank is an income test concession that helps students and Australian Apprentices keep more of their income support payment when they work. It is available to recipients of Youth Allowance (student), ABSTUDY Living Allowance and Austudy.

Recipients accrue Income Bank credits for each dollar of unused income below $$ 539$ per fortnight, which is the income free area for their payment. When they work, their credits increase the amount of employment income they can earn before their payment is reduced. Credits accrue up to a maximum of $$ 123,500$ for students, and $$ 1,000$ for Australian Apprentices.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/incomebank

# Working Credit

Working Credit is an income test concession that helps working age income support recipients keep more of their payment when they work. It is available to recipients of JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance (job seeker) and Parenting Payment, and recipients of Disability Support Pension and Carer Payment, if under Age Pension age.

Recipients accrue Working Credits for each dollar of unused income below $$ 48$ per fortnight. When they work, their credits increase the amount of employment income they can earn before their payment is reduced. Credits accrue up to a maximum of $$ 1,000$ ($3,500 for Youth Allowance (job seeker) recipients).

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/workingcredit

# Waiting periods

# Ordinary waiting period

The ordinary waiting period is a one week waiting period applied to claimants of JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance (job seeker) and Parenting Payment.

Full time tertiary students can reduce their amount of liquid assets by certain deductions for expenses related to their course of study, such as course fees, text books and software.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au

# Newly arrived resident’s waiting period

The newly arrived resident’s waiting period applies to migrants when they become the holder of a permanent visa or specified temporary visa.

The waiting period generally starts from the date the person first starts residing in Australia on the visa and ends when the person has been physically present in Australia for the required period.

There are exemptions from the newly arrived resident’s waiting period for certain payments or concession cards for people in particular circumstances.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au

# Qualifying residence period

Age Pension and Disability Support Pension have a qualifying residence period rather than a newly arrived resident’s waiting period. Parenting Payment has a qualifying residence period in addition to a newly arrived resident’s waiting period (served at the same time).

The qualifying residence period generally starts from the date the person first starts residing in Australia as an Australian citizen or permanent visa holder and ends when the person has been residing in Australia for the required period.

There are some exemptions from the qualifying residence period for people in certain circumstances.

# Definitions

# Income support payment

Income support payments provide fortnightly assistance with a person’s living costs.

For the purposes of this Guide, we classify the following payments as income support payments: Age Pension, Disability Support Pension, Carer Payment, JobSeeker Payment, Parenting Payment, Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance, Austudy, Special Benefit and Farm Household Allowance.

ABSTUDY Living Allowance is administered under guidelines outside of the Social Security Act 1991.

# Adjusted taxable income

Adjusted taxable income is used in the income tests for Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Subsidy, Parental Leave Pay, Carer Allowance and Tertiary Access Payment. It’s also used in the parental income tests for Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance and Additional Boarding Allowance, and to determine eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. Income support payments are assessed differently (page 50).

While the components may vary between these uses, adjusted taxable income can include:

• taxable income

• foreign income

• tax-exempt foreign income

• total net investment losses

• reportable fringe benefits

• reportable superannuation contributions

• certain tax free pensions or benefits

• deemed amounts from account based income streams.

Amounts of child support a person pays are deducted from their adjusted taxable income in the income tests for Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Subsidy, Parental Leave Pay and Carer Allowance, and for the parental income tests for Youth Allowance, ABSTUDY Living Allowance and Additional Boarding Allowance. Partner income can also affect a person’s adjusted taxable income.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/adjustedtaxableincome

# Family Tax Benefit child

In general, a child is a Family Tax Benefit child of an adult if they:

• are aged 0 to 15, or

• are aged 16 to 19 (up until the end of the calendar year they turn 19) and in full-time secondary study (some exemptions may apply), and

• are in the adult’s care for at least $3 5 %$ of the time, and

• meet the residence requirements (page 2), and

• don’t receive an income support payment (such as Youth Allowance), labour market program payment, or prescribed educational scheme payment (unless aged under 16, or aged 16 or over and receiving ABSTUDY and boarding away from home to attend full-time secondary study).

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/ftb

# Independence

We assess young people as being either dependent or independent when working out their entitlement to certain payments.

For Youth Allowance (page 23) and ABSTUDY (page 25), the parental income test and maintenance income test don’t apply to independent recipients. The payment rate for recipients of youth rates of Disability Support Pension (page 15) depends on whether they are assessed as dependent or independent.

A person is considered independent if they are aged 22 or over.

A person aged under 22 can be considered independent in certain circumstances, including if they:

• are or were married or in a registered relationship, or in a long term de facto relationship

• have or had a dependent child

• have supported themselves through work for a substantial period since leaving school

• have been assessed as having a partial capacity to work – Youth Allowance (job seeker) only

• have parents who can’t look after them

• are orphaned.

For Disaster Recovery Allowance (page 36) and New Zealand Disaster Recovery Allowance (page 37) one of the following must apply. The claimant:

• is not wholly or substantially dependent on another person (except the person’s partner), or • is a parent of a child, or • has income in the financial year when the determination occurs that is more than $$ 6,403$ .

For more information about independence, and more examples of circumstances where we assess a person as independent, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au or contact us on the relevant payment line (page 61).

# Definition of a partner

References in this guide to a partner apply if we consider a person a member of a couple. We consider a person to be a member of a couple if they are either:

• married, or • in a registered relationship, or • in a de facto relationship.

We may consider a person a member of a couple even if they’re not physically living with their partner. For example, their partner may fly-in fly-out or live away for work, like military or oil rig workers.

For more information, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/moc

# Australian resident

An Australian resident is a person who is residing in Australia and is:

• an Australian citizen, or • the holder of a permanent visa, or • the holder of a protected Special Category Visa.

# Residing in Australia

When we’re deciding whether a person lives in Australia, we look at the following:

• where the person lives and who they live with

• if they have family in Australia or overseas

• their employment, business or financial ties in Australia and overseas

• their assets in Australia and overseas

• how often and how long they travel outside Australia • anything else we think is relevant.

Our decisions are based on the balance of all the available evidence.

# Special Category Visa (SCV) holder

A Special Category Visa (SCV) holder is a New Zealand citizen who enters Australia on a New Zealand passport and is issued an SCV (subclass 444) on arrival.

A protected SCV holder is an SCV holder who:

• was in Australia as an SCV holder on 26 February 2001, or

• lived in Australia for 12 months in the 2 years before 26 February 2001, or

• was residing in Australia on 26 February 2001 but temporarily absent (conditions applied), or commenced or recommenced residing in Australia within 3 months of 26 February 2001 and were subsequently assessed as holding protected status (time limit applied).

An SCV holder who does not meet the definition of protected SCV holder is a non-protected SCV holder.

# Specified temporary visa holder

Holders of the following specified temporary visas may qualify for certain payments even though they are not considered an Australian resident:

• subclass 060 – Bridging F

• subclass 070 – Bridging (Removal Pending)

• subclass 309 – Partner (Provisional)

• subclass 449 – Humanitarian Stay (Temporary)

• subclass 785 – Temporary Protection

• subclass 786 – Temporary (Humanitarian Concern)

• subclass 790 – Safe Haven Enterprise

• subclass 820 – Partner

# Eligible Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme worker or family member

An eligible Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme worker or family member is a person who holds a subclass 403 visa and is either a worker in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme that has been approved to bring members of their family to Australia as part of the family accompaniment initiative, or the family member of such a worker.

# General information

# Dates benefits are payable

We make most payments from, or after, the date a person makes their claim. So the sooner they submit their claim the quicker we can pay them.

# Making a claim for payment

Generally, a person must be in Australia on the day a claim for a payment or card is made (some exemptions may apply, including where claiming under an International Social Security Agreement).

# Separated couples

Partnered people may receive certain single rates of payment if they are in respite care, or if they are separated from their partner due to illness or imprisonment.

# Payment method

We generally make payments into a bank, credit union or building society account. Some exemptions may apply.

# Reviews and appeals

If a customer disagrees with a decision we make about their payment, they can ask for an explanation or apply for a formal review of the decision.

If a customer disagrees with the outcome of a formal review, they can ask the Administrative Review Tribunal to review the decision.

Go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/reviewsandappeals for more information.

# Bereavement support

We have payments and services for people who experience the loss of someone close to them, such as a partner, a child or someone they are caring for. For more information, resources and support, go to servicesaustralia.gov.au/bereavement
