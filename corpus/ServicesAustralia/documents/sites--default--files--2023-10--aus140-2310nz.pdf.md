# Information about claiming Australian pension • continued

# Confidential use of personal information

Personal information is treated as confidential and can only be released to someone else in special circumstances, where the law requires or where you give permission. If you have concerns about your personal information contact us. We will look into the matter and tell you about your rights to see and amend your information. If you are still not satisfied, you can contact the Privacy Commissioner at GPO Box 5218, Sydney NSW 2001, AUSTRALIA.

# Your obligations

Australian pension is paid subject to an income and assets test.

Most forms of income will affect the amount of Australian pension that you can be paid. The income test allows you to receive an amount of income before your Australian pension will be affected. You are required to tell us about all of the income that you receive and we will work out how it affects the amount of Australian pension that you can be paid.

The assets test allows you to have a certain level of assets before your Australian pension will be affected. As with income, you are required to tell us of all of your assets and we will tell you how they affect your Australian pension.

# The income test

How much payment you receive will depend on your circumstances and your (and/or your partner’s) income and assets.

We calculate the amount that could be paid to you, and if applicable, to your partner under both the income test and the assets test. The test giving the lower rate of payment is the one used to pay you and/or your partner.

Income includes money received from employment and money deemed to be earned from investments. It also includes money from outside Australia.

You can have income up to certain amounts before your payment is reduced.

# Your income may include:

• deemed income from financial assets

gross employment income (i.e. income before tax) income received to provide care net income from business, including farms family trust distributions or dividends from private company shares income attributable to the controllers of a private trust or private company

• income from rental property income from a life interest

• income from boarders and lodgers (other than immediate family)

• superannuation and pensions from countries other than Australia

• income from income stream products, superannuation pensions and annuities.

For more information about income visit servicesaustralia.gov.au/income

# The assets test

Most things you own have a value and can be counted as assets. This includes assets held outside Australia. For the purpose of calculating your payment, the value of your assets is what you would get for them if you sold them.

Generally, any debt owing on an asset is deducted from the value of the asset.

# Your assets may include:

• rental properties, farms, second or holiday houses

• cars, caravans, boats or trailers

• home contents and personal effects, including antiques or other collectables

• the market or trade value of all savings and investments, including funeral bonds

• loans you have made to other people, family trusts and companies

• value of most income stream products

• business assets

• interest in a private trust or private company

• superannuation investments held by people over Age Pension age

• licenses, for example fishing or taxi

• surrender value of life insurance policies, and

• any assets given away or sold for less that their market value within the last five yea

# The following assets are NOT included:

• your principal family home (and up to 2 hectares of privately used surrounding land that is on the same title), and any permanent fixtures such as wall-to-wall carpet and wall heaters

• some income stream products

• cemetery plots and pre-paid funeral expenses

• any property or monies left to you in an estate which you are not yet able to receive, generally for a period up to 12 months

• accommodation bonds paid to an aged care home or on entry to residential aged care

• aids for people with a disability

• monies received from the National Disability Insurance Scheme to provide for the needs of people with a disability

• most compensation or insurance payments for loss or damage to buildings or personal effects

• any life interest, reversionary interest, remainder interest or contingent interest unless it was created by you, your partner or at the time of death of your partner, and

• assets up to a certain limit held in a Special Disability Trust (SDT) for an immediate family member.

These are called exempt assets.
