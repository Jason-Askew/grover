# When you arrive

Please tell us you’re here on the day you arrive so we can help you as soon as possible.

Use the [notification of refugee arrival form](/ss459) to let us know you have arrived in Australia. Your coordinator or case worker can complete this form for you.

## New claim interview

When we’re told you have arrived, we’ll book an interview with you. We can also arrange an interpreter for you.

If you don’t have a service provider helping you, call the [Multilingual Phone Service](#toolbar-phone) to speak to someone in your language. They’ll book the interview for you.

Use the [claim for persons granted a Refugee, Humanitarian or Protection visa form](/ss415) to claim a payment if you’ve recently arrived in Australia. Your coordinator or case worker may help you complete this form before your interview.

Contact numbers available on this page.
